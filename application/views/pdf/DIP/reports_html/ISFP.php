<p class="body1">ISFP's primary mode of living is internally focused, where they deal with things according to how they feel about them, or how they fit into their value systems. Their secondary mode is external, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
ISFPs use their five senses to relate to the world they live in. As such they are aware of and in touch with how things taste, look, sound, smell and feel. They have an ability to use this awareness to create and compose items that will affect the senses in an artistic manner. They are more likely than any other type to pursue an artistic career direction.</p>
<p class="body1">Although ISFPs are reserved, quiet and difficult to get to know, they are gentle, kind and sensitive in their interactions with others, especially those they care about. Most of the time they are difficult to get to know and they tend to hold back their opinions and thoughts until they know others better. They like to contribute to the happiness and wellbeing of others, and will go to great lengths to complete the tasks they believe in. ISFPs tend to be service orientated, with a desire to make others happy and to please them. They tend to show their caring through deeds rather than words.</p></td>

<p class="body1">Original and independent, the ISFP needs personal space to recharge their batteries and to reflect. They get along with those who make an effort to understand them and who are willing to support them in pursuing their goals. The ISFP creates the impression of carefree light-heartedness, but they tend to be serious individuals, constantly looking for information using their value system in order to clarify and understand the hidden meaning of things.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs are action orientated and like to solve practical problems. They do not particularly like delving into ideas and theories, unless a practical application exists. They learn through 'hands-on' experiences and tend to get bored with traditional learning methods. The idea of basing their decisions on impersonal analysis and strict logic does not appeal to them. Their decisions are strongly influenced by their value systems which is based on their own subjective beliefs, rather than those dictated by laws or objective rules.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs are aware of those around them and gifted at their perception of people. They like to gather information about people and constantly seek to discover the meaning thereof. Their insights and perceptions of others are usually accurate and penetrating. ISFPs tend to be independent and don't generally aspire to leadership positions. Likewise, they don't like to be controlled by others. Living their lives from an internally driven value system can sometimes drive them to be perfectionistic in living up to these values. They tend not to give themselves enough credit for that which they do very well. They also tend to judge themselves harshly.</p>


<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ISFP's skills are in anything related to the tactical, being able to manoeuvre in order to overcome obstacles. As such they are resourceful and, like the ISTP, are skilled at using whatever is at hand to get the job done. They are more inclined to improve on and use what exists to assist, as opposed to thinking up entirely new ideas or concepts.</p>


<p class="body1">ISFPs bring the unique gift of being able to use their senses to create artistic works and compose music. They excel in mixing line, colour, shading, texture, touch and motion. Once engaged, ISFPs become absorbed in what they do, and they derive pleasure from being able to contribute to the wellbeing of others through their compositions. They find joy and reward in the reactions evoked by the works of art.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFPs are known for their drive to achieve perfection and seek it in everything they do. They will strive to enhance their skills, and are dedicated workers. They are able to develop variations on themes, and are skilled at executing minute changes which allow them to create behaviours and situations with infinite possibilities. As such they excel in the performing and composing arts, as well as at creating or shaping aesthetics.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs are free spirits and like the freedom of being able to express their artistic inclinations in a calm, quiet space. Although they are not known for their communication ability, their use of language is normally filled with concrete expressions. ISFPs thus prefer action to words, with the exception of those inclined to create using words or song as a creative medium; such as novelists and songwriters. If they choose to pursue such a course, their language tends to be full of concrete and realistic images.</p>
<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>
<p class="body1">ISFPs work well in an environment where they are allowed to practise their skills in a quiet and stimulating atmosphere. They also do well in physically attracted workspaces and, although they might not always keep their space tidy, they will know where to find things.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs liked to be challenged and are good at responding to crisis situations as well as solving problems. They do especially well with opportunities that allow them to assist people in distress. ISFPs also like their jobs to provide varied and exciting opportunities.</p>
<p class="body1">In order to satisfy their need for perfection, ISFPs should be allowed ample opportunity for rehearsal. Change is better received if they can be involved in some kind of 'hands on' action. Personal dignity and freedom are important to them. ISFPs tend to want as much of this as possible; therefore contracts and job obligations should provide choice in terms of their obligations and commitments. ISFPs are committed and hard workers, especially if it allows for their behavioural effectiveness to be improved upon and even perfected. They are embarrassed by clumsy performance, both their own and that of others. Provide as many opportunities as possible for ISFPs to exercise their craftsmanship and skills, art and grace.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFPs appreciate feedback in the form of the impact they make on those around them. Be sure that they don't go for lengths of time with nothing to do. They value the opportunity for action. Consequently ISFPs do not react well to routine or the expectation to adhere to structure and hierarchy. They are not dependent on policies or specific instructions, and prefer to learn and perfect what they do as they go along. ISFPs value pleasure; having fun and working in an aesthetic and pleasing environment brings out the best in them. Being fond of action, they also tend to enjoy activities in nature and the outdoors.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs value environments where people are cheerful and optimistic; they are able to look for the uplifting and positive in almost any situation. Thus they do not do well in workspaces where negativity reigns. Neither do they cope well with ambiguous situations. Similarly, this is the case with conflict, and ISFPs will rather leave a situation than stay in a space with negative energy.</p>
<p class="body1">Opportunities to challenge the tried and tested energise ISFPs, especially if they are allowed to perform within the predetermined parameters. Orientated to perform their best in an action orientated fashion, ISFPs do even better if they have the opportunity to vary their actions. They do their best in 'here and now' situations. They love to please others, and like harmony to prevail in their work environment. Don't be mistaken, the ISFP will not obediently please, but should do better if they can have an impact on others through their actions.</p>
<p class="body1">ISFPs will challenge authority if they feel it stands in the way of getting things done. Authority is granted to those whom they admire for their creative initiative and superior performance. Working best in an environment of harmony, they react negatively to interpersonal tension and anxiety. Authority figures should recognise that ambivalent conditions and conflict situations hamper the ISFP's ability to perform to their best ability.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">As can be expected, ISFPs learn best through 'hands-on' methods of learning, especially participative projects and being allowed to acquire skills in the 'here and now'. They retain learning better through being shown how to do things rather than hearing about them. Like the ISTP, they are not inclined to read manuals or directions, believing in their own ability to solve concrete problems. Neither do they like learning through the written medium.</p>
<p>ISFPs have very well developed observational skills and use this to great success in combination with their other senses when learning. Being concrete and specific by nature, abstract presentations and theoretical speculation act as a turn-off for ISFPs and should best be ignored. Learning is normally undertaken for the results it can produce, the tools it can provide, in addition to the fun it offers. Being able to apply what they've learned immediately and in a practical manner holds great appeal to an ISFP.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>


<p class="body1">The ISFP manager leads in a humanitarian manner, making an effort to understand subordinates and in an easy-going fashion. They are expedient and pragmatic, and will do whatever needs to be done to complete assignments and jobs with the least amount of effort. They appreciate efficiency and will assist others in a likewise fashion. Their management style is geared to taking action, all the while gently persuading employees to get the job done. They do well in solving immediate and concrete problems.</p>

<p class="body1">Like the ISTP, the ISFP manager is more likely to ignore policies and procedures if they get in the way of work execution. ISFP managers are good at providing concrete and specific solutions. They are particularly good at spotting inefficiencies and malfunctions, and will assist in any manner whatsoever to rectify the problem.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFP managers tend to get so absorbed in solving present-moment problems that they tend to fail to focus on future orientated planning. Neither do they like following agendas. At times, it is difficult for them to delegate, as they themselves are usually so good at individual performance that they don't see the need to teach others. They are nevertheless very good at getting people to work together, and are able to create a work environment of harmony and understanding. They do not particularly impose or like to direct, and rather provide opportunity for others to demonstrate their skills.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFP managers will get involved in the people crises of others and will work tirelessly to alleviate their suffering. They are kind and give freely to those requiring their assistance.</p>

<p class="body1">They are probably the most egalitarian of all types. They do not function well in hierarchical systems, unless it facilitates people and enables them to do their jobs.
<p class="body1">Other types who report in to the ISFP might experience discomfort with the ISFP's willingness to ignore policies, procedures and tradition in order to get the job done. Neither are ISFP managers uncomfortable with the unknown, as long as the can be in the middle of it. Employees of a different type might find this kind of behaviour threatening and disruptive. ISFP managers are however able to provide feedback and will do so willingly.</p>

<p class="body1">Being easy to get along with and able to get people to co-operate, ISFP managers have a genuine desire to assist others to enjoy and have fun in the space where they work. They give easily of themselves and expect the same of others. ISFP managers are open and flexible, with an ability to change their opinion as new facts are presented. They are very much aware of their surroundings and will detect subtle changes in people behaviour and attitude. They do not though like the unfamiliar and may be uncomfortable with changes that they themselves have not instigated.</p>
<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>
<p class="body1">The ISFP's egalitarian attitude causes them to share freely, generally accepting the same from others and sometimes to their own detriment. It could assist ISFPs to seek the objective viewpoint of other people to create more informed opinions and to protect themselves. The ISFP's focus on the present takes so much energy that they might sometimes need to remind themselves to focus on other, more important objectives, such as making provision for the future.</p>
<p class="body1">The ISFP's preference for improvisation is so strong and focused that they can sometimes miss the implications of their actions, especially negative reactions from others. This can lead to misunderstandings, especially when working with people of different types.</p>

<p class="body1">Their focus on immediate action and 'quick-fixes' deters them from long range planning or looking at more permanent solutions. Their need for spontaneity can likewise detract focus from the future. Combined with their eagerness and comfort to change course can cause them to be perceived as a challenge to the stabilising force of more traditional organisations.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFPs have a strong dislike for the negative and would rather ignore such events in order to get to the cause of the conflict. As a result, they might be blinded to the more subtle group dynamics that exist between people, which could have a negative impact on interpersonal relationships. ISFPs could be assisted by other types to deal with these factors in a gentle and calm manner. It might though not be easy as the ISFP finds it difficult to work with those they have come to dislike.</p>
