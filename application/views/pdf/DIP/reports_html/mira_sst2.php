        <p>The Matrix of Intellectual Reasoning Assessment (MIRA)is a non-verbal mental ability test that requires test-takers to find solutions to a range of different problems. It measures observation skills, thinking ability, intellectual capacity and efficiency. It also measures one's ability to formulate new concepts, extract meaning out of ambiguity and to think clearly about complex situations and events.</p>
       <br/><br/>
       <p>The Stratified Systems Theory (SST) developed by Eliot Jaquesdefines work in different organisationallevels, mainly on the basis of decision-making complexity. MIRA measures the individual's ability to find solutions through different levels of complex problems.</p>

    <p>It seems that they might find working in an environment where they have to solve problems where answers are not very clear by using their knowledge and/or experience. They tend to ask clarifying questions to ensure they get to the correct answer or solution. The environment they seem to prefer to work in is mostly structured and routine-based, however with some flexibility of choice. </p>
    <p>Leaders on this level tend to lead self as well as moving into an environment where they may be required to manage other technical and/or operational people.</p>
