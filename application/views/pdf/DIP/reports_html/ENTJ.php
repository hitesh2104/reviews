    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">The ENTJ's primary mode of living is externally focused, indicating that they prefer to deal with issues in a rational and logical manner. Their secondary mode is internal, where they use intuition to absorb information.</p>
<p class="body1">ENTJs can be described as 'natural born leaders'. They are engaged in and excited by a world of possibilities and challenges, and like to be the ones to overcome these challenges. They are adept at grasping complexities, and can absorb a large amount of information in order to generate quick and decisive judgements. If things don't happen quickly enough for their liking, they are likely to 'take charge'.</p>
<p class="body1">The corporate world is a natural fit for ENTJ's career focused aspirations. Potential problem situations attract their attention, and they are eager to seek solutions to difficult problems. They are naturally gifted in identifying plans to solve problems, in addition to being able to look at situations from a long term perspective. As such, ENTJs are usually successful in the business environment. With energy directed tirelessly to the requirements of a job, in addition to being able to lead and visualise the direction of the organisation, they make natural corporate leaders.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs are irritated by mistakes and will seek to eliminate errors. As such, they are impatient with inefficiency and may become harsh and blunt in their feedback, especially since they are not naturally attuned to other people's emotions. They might thus struggle to see things from other people's perspective and have little patience with different viewpoints or opinions. A great challenge to ENTJs is to recognise the value of the opinions of other, as well as developing sensitivity for their feelings. The possibility exists that ENTJs may consequently be excluded from important information and the collaboration needed in order to be successful leaders.</p>

<p class="body1">An underdeveloped Intuition could cause ENTJs to make hasty decisions, without devoting sufficient time to understand issues and seek solutions. An underdeveloped Thinking side could be equally detrimental due to difficulty in applying logic to their insights. As such, they will be good at obtaining insight, but will lack the ability to act upon or understand the true value of their insights.</p>


<p class="body1">Although ENTJs are not naturally interested in the emotions of other people, they love to interact. Lively, challenging conversations come naturally to them and they find them satisfying. Respect is granted to those who are able to stand up to them and are able to argue persuasively. Self confidence and verbal communication skills are inherent, which may frighten other people.
</p>
<p class="body1">
Balance is not easy for an ENTJ due to their ambitious nature. ENTJs are innovative, assertive long range thinkers with a rare quality: the ability to translate theories and possibilities into solid action plans. ENTJs are forceful personalities who are likely to accomplish the goals they set for themselves.
</p>
<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ENTJs bring and expand great energy to the workplace. This energy is normally directed to the acquisition of knowledge, competencies and the implementation of their vision. ENTJs set high expectations for themselves, and expect the same of others.
</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs are skilled at analysis, with an ability to identify conceptual discrepancies and to create categories. They are able to act as competent strategists, mapping out all feasible opportunities well in advance, developing an action agenda and an overall scheme for their plan(s). They are good at building models, especially theoretical ones, in addition to solving problems, riddles and enigmas.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTJs have a knack of motivating people to work toward goals. They are good at generating 'why' questions, and will debate the merit of solutions based on their appetite for knowledge. As such, they are adept at seeking and establishing efficiency. They will typically pursue investigations into ideas and concepts in a quest to learn more. Where others perceive obstacles as stumbling blocks, they typically perceive them as stepping stones.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs are well versed and energetic conversationalists, with an ability to communicate with precision. They are able to follow the complex articulation of others, and are skilful in noticing inconsistencies, contradictions and shifts in position. The ability to reason logically is a gift which they apply naturally in any work environment. They look for and seek the rationale behind decisions, organisational policies and events, and can be asked to provide insight and logic when needed. When conversing, ENTJs get to the point quickly and efficiently.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTJs tend to believe that talking too much, 'wastes' others' time, and perceive this to be a sign of disrespect, needing to be avoided if possible. Their priority is to 'get to the point' and they expect the same of others.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTJs will take control if they perceive a lack of order in the workplace. Being in command comes naturally, and they tend to take the lead in establishing and defining relationships. Achievement is important to them and they will constantly strive for competency. They are driven by their own standards as opposed to external expectations, and will pursue their goals when possible. They also have the ability to derive excitement and commitment from others for organisational goals in which they believe.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">The most favourable environment for an ENTJ is one which allows them to take charge and devise strategies for areas they can call their own. Thus, the ideal corporate structure is one in which they are provided with opportunities to take command and guide the organisation toward solutions to long term significant goals. Creating opportunities to develop strategy and solve complex problems is right up their alley and where they are applied best. They are good at understanding causes, adept at finding reasons, and can assist effectively in change interventions. Thus ENTJs function well in an environment which expects them to develop new solutions to old problems, and can become exceptional 'organisation builders'.</p>


<p class="body1">It is important to provide ENTJs with positive feedback and informal reassurance, even if they might not acknowledge a need for it. They value feedback from those they judge to be competent, and appreciate knowing that their efforts yield positive results. If however the ENTJ receives feedback from a person they view as incompetent, or in a personal emotional manner, it will simply not be accepted or given consideration.</p>


<p class="body1">Feedback provided in a rational and logical manner will have greater impact than that delivered in an emotional manner. Some ENTJs find it very difficult to deal with what they perceive to be feelings and sentiment, and might even give the impression that they 'shut down'. They work best in a calm atmosphere where accuracy is valued. Other turn ons include coherence, justice and a sense of moving towards what is possible. They value the opportunity to learn, and in the absence thereof might even create their own learning opportunities. They enjoy competition, sometimes just for the fun of it, and while others are concerned about the outcome, ENTJs tend to enjoy the process more than the end product.</p>



<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>


<p class="body1">ENTJs are constantly looking for opportunities to learn. They love pursuing a new concept or idea, and will go to great lengths to obtain new information. In order to optimise the learning experience, they will go well through a process of conceptualising. Imagining the abstract holds their attention and they are adept at developing categories. Rote and association learning bores them and should be avoided. A fear of failure can also inhibit learning.</p>



<h1>Management Style</h1>


<p class="body1">The management style of ENTJs is likely to be action oriented, direct and, in some people's opinion, a bit forceful. As visionaries they are able to create and communicate an impression of how the organisation can change. They are naturally gifted in marshalling the necessary human and material forces to achieve their envisaged future goals and objectives. As such, ENTJs are likely to take charge with such self assurance that others follow readily.</p>


<p class="body1">They expect subordinates to carry out their well thought through and outlined plans autonomously and independently, because this is 'how they would do it'. ENTJs sometimes make the mistake of assuming that they are understood, which could cause their communication to become terse if they are required to repeat themselves; something they don't like doing. ENTJs also tend to leave out the detail of their vision and plans, which could result in the impression that they are arrogant.</p>

<p class="body1">As managers they are comfortable in making decisions, and their focus is normally on goals supporting their vision of where the organisation should be going. ENTJs are naturally sensitive to the inner workings of the organization, as well as its various sub systems.</p>

<p class="body1">If required, ENTJs are willing to be team players, if that is what it takes to get the job done. Efficiency is their main goal, aiming to get the most for the least effort. They tend to be impatient with mistakes, errors and having to repeat themselves, and sometimes think that praising others is redundant. ENTJs tend to be uncomfortable with giving and receiving praise. It could be beneficial to coach the ENTJ manager on the importance of positive feedback to other types, and how to show a greater appreciation for the efforts of others. Once they are convinced of the practical value this has, it tends to be more forthcoming.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development</h1>

<p class="body1">ENTJs tend to be impatient with those who need time for reflection and research. Once they've made up their minds, it becomes difficult to convince them otherwise. It could be mutually beneficial to become more tolerant and to take the 'human element', as well as the contribution others make, into account in order to allow for alternative solutions.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTJs are focused on achieving their goals with a sense of urgency. Those who are perceived to get in the way of their advancement can expect irritation and resistance, sometimes at the cost of perfection. Developing an ability to carefully consider all sides of an issue could enhance the successful outcome of their plans and goals. If however they are overwhelmed by a fear of failure, they may become trapped in the planning phase, developing elaborate and detailed plans of what to do. Although the latter occurs less frequently, such delaying tactics, once noted, can alert the ENTJ to identify, address and resolve the fears leading to such behaviour.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs tend to look down on those they perceive as less intellectually gifted and abstract than themselves, and tend to miss the opportunity to obtain alternative views and ideas. The support of other colleagues, those with a tendency towards the practical and concrete, could contribute to the successful completion of their plans, and ENTJs would do well to cultivate greater tolerance for the gifts of others. They also tend to become disappointed when others do not move as quickly as they do or work as independently as they prefer to do. Becoming aware of the strengths of other Types can assist greatly in this regard.
</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs are reminded to take care of their feelings and to give attention to those who report to them. Although they function well in a calm environment and feel uncomfortable with the exaggerated expression of feelings, the opportunity to discuss feelings will prevent undue emotional outbursts and provide an opportunity for sharing. Practising listening skills could aid in this regard.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTJs would benefit from identifying work environments and career opportunities where they can solve problems. They also need to be aware of their tendency to take responsibility for the problems of other. The maintenance of healthy boundaries and ensuring that their assistance is warranted and needed could prevent over involvement in others' problems.</p>
