    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">INFJ's primary mode of living is focused internally, where they take things in primarily via intuition. Their secondary mode is external, where they deal with things according to how they feel about them, or how they fit with their personal value systems.</p>
<p class="body1">The impression created by INFJs is that they are complex, caring, gentle, and highly intuitive human beings. INFJs have an affinity for the creative and artistic, and often find themselves living in a world of hidden possibilities and meanings. Very few people have an INFJ's personality type, in some populations as little as one percent. It is the rarest personality type of all.
</p>
<p class="body1">INFJs feel comfortable in an orderly and systematic outer world and put a lot of energy into identifying the most appropriate way to get things done. They will typically ponder the priorities in their lives, which tend to change often. INFJs prefer an internal world where their intuition plays a strong part. They are particularly good at 'knowing things', sometimes without being able to pinpoint why or to have detailed knowledge. Being right most of the time is often the cause for placing a great deal of faith in their intuitions and instincts.</p></td>

<p> INFJ's Judging preference, in combination with Intuition, sometimes leads to a conflict between their inner and outer worlds, and the INFJ might not be as organised as other Judging types tend to be.</p>


<p class="body1">INFJ's ability to gain insight into people and situations is tremendous. In extreme cases some INFJs report on what is known as psychic experiences. They might have had a strong feeling about a loved one, and found out that their concerns were valid. Representing such a small percentage of the population in combination with this ability is sometimes the cause of being misunderstood and can lead to feelings of being different. As a result, INFJs tend to be protective of their inner selves, carefully choosing who to share it with. Some perceive them as deeply complex, secretive and sometimes difficult to understand.</p>

<p class="body1">Those who do get to know the INFJ, will find them warm and caring. They are concerned with other people's feelings, and will not intentionally hurt others. They do not tolerate conflict very well, and situations where conflict is prolonged, might illicit a state of charged anger and agitation from the normally gentle and calm INFJ. Stress is internalised and can manifest itself as the experience of health problems.</p>

<p class="body1">Trusting their intuitive instincts may result in INFJs becoming stubborn and ignoring the opinions of others. INJFs are typically hard on themselves, believing that they are not living up to their full potential. They are rarely at complete peace with themselves, and can always do more to work on themselves or to perfect the world. Striving to grow continuously, they often don't acknowledge their own accomplishments. INFJs tend to have high expectations of themselves and those close to them; they don't believe in compromising their ideals.</p>

<p class="body1">With a preference for creativity and independence, INFJs are attracted to the world of art, although some are found in the field of science, a space where they can make use of their intuition. Being caring and interested in others, they also excel in the service-orientated professions.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<p class="body1">INFJs excel at working with people; they are able to deploy them, handle them, train them and to motivate, recruit, counsel and support others in order to achieve their aspirations and goals. INFJs have the ability to listen carefully to what others say and, in some instances, what they are not saying. They are so good at this that they are sometimes able to finish the sentences of others with surprising accuracy.</p>

<p class="body1">INFJs function particularly well in one-on-one relationships, and they prefer these kind of relationships above public displays and interaction. They are good corporate citizens, getting along with others, and through the use of their interpersonal warmth and other abilities are able to achieve outstanding results by working through and with others. As such, INFJ managers are likely to be devoted to creating the best possible working conditions for all. Likewise, they will take a personal interest in the growth of other individuals' personal development. INFJs are skilled at providing meaningful and insight provoking feedback, although they sometimes need to be asked for it.</p>

<p class="body1">INJFs are adept communicators who listen and respond well to the information provided by others. They tend to be metaphoric and global in the way they verbalise things, and might be misunderstood by some personality types who differ from them. INFJs are always searching for the meaning in words and communication which makes them especially talented in the use of written language. The human side interests them, and they are able to relate great understanding of the human experience in metaphorical terms.</p>

<p class="body1">INFJs are also well placed in the technical fields, especially in environments that allow for their intuitive side. They are able to bring great problem-solving and ingenuity talents to problem solving and tasks. Their ability to write is often a rewarding and precise outlet for these talents, especially if they are allowed to use metaphors and images. INFJs are able to provide the reader with greater insight and understanding, especially in the human side of enterprise.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">INFJs work well in an environment that is perceived by them to be moral and ethical in nature. They want the 'greater' good for all and feel committed and inspired in a space that allows for human development and meaning. If they are allowed to engage in meaningful relationships and these provide development and growth to all, the INFJ will be even
happier. Although they know that a perfect world does not exist, they are likely to take it upon themselves to seek organisations and positions where they can enhance understanding and build harmony. Their own, as well as the integrity of others, are very important and they do not fare well in a manipulative or insincere environment. With their highly developed people insight, which almost borders on the psychic, they are quick to identify such environments and will most likely opt to leave as opposed to going against their values.</p>

<p class="body1">Engaging in meaningful relationships where there is warmth, human understanding and harmony, brings out the best in INFJs. They have a tendency to ignore the 'darker side' and might even be disillusioned once they experience that their focus on harmony and ideals is not always shared by others. Even better if they can work for a leader, a purpose or a cause that truly inspires them. Because the meaning of life is so important to them, they are strongly motivated by the unusual, the incredibly important and a deep sense of compassion which is the 'glue' that holds their worlds together. INFJs work well in everyday routine, as long at the environment is harmonious and supportive.</p>

<p class="body1">INFJs flourish in a workspace where they are expected to solve problems, especially those directed at solving human, system-related problems. They are especially good at digging into and revealing the reasons why people say and do certain things, to an extent that it is more important than the substance of specific events.</p>

<p class="body1">As mentioned, INFJs work well in a space where their need for empathic relationships is met. The deeper and more meaningful, the better. They are particularly good at creating rapport with others, and also value authentic interaction with others. Thus, the more meaningful the environment, in addition to providing authentic and deep human interaction, the more enthused, dedicated and devoted the INFJ will be. They are receptive to change, especially if it is for the 'greater good' of all employees in an organisation. They work well for ethical, authentic and good leaders and managers. Thus authority is not granted by position, but earned through exemplary behaviour.</p>

<p class="body1">Managers will do well to know that INFJs prefer harmonious situations and that they tend to ignore conflict and find it difficult to deal with. They are comfortable with the expression of strong emotion, and this ability can be used to the benefit of conflict solution, as long as it is fair and everyone gets an opportunity to speak, with the goal being consensus.</p>

<p class="body1">Thus the ideal work environment for an INFJ is one which focuses on people and their needs. The organisation itself should also have an identity and a purpose to the INFJ's liking, especially one that goes beyond the everyday routine. Working in an environment where resources are harnessed towards a higher goal beyond the everyday routine of 'business as usual' really brings out the best in the INFJ.</p>
<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">Interaction and dialogue, combined with the written word, are ways in which the INFJ is able to learn new information. They are interested in theories, ideas and concepts   especially those that focus on human phenomena and scientific areas. As a result they are good at attaining skills which explain human motivation. The learning environment and the manner in which it is put together can either hinder or help an INFJ. The more personal and the more understanding there is between teacher and pupil, the greater the learning. INFJs don't do well with an authoritarian style of instruction.</p>

<p class="body1">They are able to see relationships between concepts and can synthesise in order to make learning easier. INFJs might be supported by focusing their attention on the detail of what they learn as their natural preference is global and diffused. They learn easily from written work and lectures, and tend to be abstract learners who enjoy expanding their horizons through exposure to new concepts and ideas.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
 
 <p class="body1">The INFJ's management style is geared towards supporting and bringing out the best in human behaviour and potential. Their manner of leading is through example. Although very personal, INFJ managers lead in an orderly and predictable manner. They both strive for and take the responsibility they have for people and the organisation seriously. They will work to establish and maintain positive interpersonal relationships with their subordinates and, where possible, build a well-functioning, harmonious team. Although they value procedure, rules and 'the system', they are unlikely to insist on these because, in their view, this might stifle a climate of freedom and autonomy that is needed to promote the growth of employees. They are firstly committed to people, and then only will they focus on the overall purpose of the organisation. If these two are in harmony, INFJ managers attain contentment and satisfaction with a job well done.</p>

<p class="body1">When change is proposed, INFJ managers are likely to ask if it will be good 'for the people'. The pace of change if also important to them, as is the way in which it is communicated and accepted or rejected by employees. In highly task-driven organisations where the focus is on task delivery, INFJ managers are known to suspend organisational purposes in order to accommodate human needs. Under pressure INJFs become distressed, and if there is conflict between the employee and employer they may find themselves experiencing such frustration and bewilderment that they can become incapacitated.</p>

<p class="body1">INFJ managers will strive to bring out the best in their subordinates and simultaneously endeavour to create 'perfect' work outcomes and solutions. They also have a tendency to be dedicated and hard workers, and will sometimes take on so much responsibility that they can become overworked. They will also take on responsibility for other team members and might find it difficult to say 'no'. Although INFJs are deeply interested in others and work to their benefit, they can feel overwhelmed when expected to interact with a great number of people; this could result in loss of productivity. INFJ managers also work better focusing on one task at a time and will find unannounced interruptions frustrating, although they might not always show it.</p>

<p class="body1">INFJ managers are masterful at showing appreciation, both verbally and non-verbally, and will do so at every opportunity they get. They have an amazing ability to focus on, listen to and give employees their full attention. Likewise, the INFJ manager is motivated by encouragement, feedback and appreciation from others. Although loyal to the organisation and the people they work with, if forced to choose, the INFJ's preference will most likely always go to the individual. Where high turnover and frequent staff changes exist, there is also a possibility for the INFJ to become demoralised and to lose enthusiasm for their work. At times the INFJ manager's tendency to support the 'under-dog' can lead to disharmony, exactly what INFJs do not like.</p>

<p class="body1">Being orderly by nature and enjoying a predictable environment tends to lead to an appreciation for opportunities to complete tasks. They appreciate the experience of completion. Working on too many projects out of sequence can cause frustration and a dilution of focus, and it is advised to assist them in working on one task at a time, allowing opportunity for completion and not interrupting them too often.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>

<p class="body1">As can be expected, the INFJ's focus on the human element can be to such an extent that they lose their sense of perspective. A tendency to be so dedicated to a cause, a purpose or sometimes a person, can lead such a state of idealising that all becomes subordinated to their own needs.</p>
