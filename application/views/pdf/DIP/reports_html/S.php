<p class="body1">This type of profile, showing a high level of Steadiness with no
other balancing factors, is comparatively rare, especially in
Western societies. Steadiness is the factor of patience, calmness
and gentle openness, and a pure High-S will reflect these
qualities. They are generally amiable and warm-hearted, being
sympathetic to others' points of view, and valuing positive
interaction with others. They are not outgoing by nature,
however, and rely on other, more assertive, people to take the
lead.

<h1>Relating to Others</h1>
<p>As in their general lifestyle, this type will look to more socially assertive people to initiate relationships of any kind - their solid, dependable outlook makes them far more suited to the maintenance of interpersonal relations than making initial contact. For this reason, their circle of friends and close acquaintances is often small but tightly-knit.</p>

    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">This person's particular strengths can be summarised as supportive. They are dependable and loyal, this combines with an emotional literacy to make them particularly effective listeners and counsellors. They are also unusually persistent in approach, having the patience and restraint to work steadily at a task until it is achieved. This makes them unusually capable of dealing with laborious tasks that many other styles would simply not have the patience to complete. </p><br />

    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">The underlying patience of this type of person is the root of their motivating factors. They need to feel that they have the support of those around them and, more importantly, time to adapt to new situations. They have an inherent dislike of change, and will prefer to maintain the status quo whenever possible; sudden alterations in their circumstances can be very difficult for them to deal with.</p>
<p class="body1">Once embarked on a task, they will wish to concentrate closely on it and see it through. Interruptions and distractions of any kind can be particularly demotivating in these situations.</p>
