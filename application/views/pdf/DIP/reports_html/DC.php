<h1>Your Report</h1>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">This 'U'-shaped profile is not uncommon. It represents a highly
formal and structured individual with a forceful and blunt
style. This type of person believes in getting things right, and is
rarely afraid to state their mind robustly and directly. Of all
possible DISC profiles, this style probably represents the least
forthcoming in personal or emotional matters; individuals of
this type tend to be remote and somewhat isolated, preferring
to keep their own counsel.
 </p>
 <br /><br />
 <h1>Relating to Others</h1>
<p>As we suggested above, relating to others (at least on a personal level) is not a high priority for this type of person. When communication with others is essential, it tends to be brief and succinct, focusing on practical matters. This type of individual is quite distrustful of others, and will prefer to keep facts to themselves unless absolutely necessary.</p><br /></td>

<h1><br />Common Abilities</h1>

    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">This is a behavioural style motivated by achievement and efficiency, as are all styles containing a high level of Dominance. In this case, however, this is modulated by the presence of a high Compliance factor, which also lends the character an interest in detail and precision. A noticeable element of this particular type, for example, is their tendency to correct other people when they make errors, even to the point of highlighting mistakes that others might regard as trivial or unimportant. </p>
    <p class="body1">Nonetheless, this combination of efficiency and precision can be an effective one, and their bluntly assertive style helps them to achieve difficult tasks by sheer force of character. </p><br /><br /><br /><br />

<h1>Motivating Factors</h1>

    <td width="390" >
<p class="body1">This is a complex character in terms of motivation. In common with all High-D's, they have a desire for personal achievement and success, but they also like to feel that they are completing assignments or projects accurately and efficiently. The naturally inexpressive style of this type can make it difficult to detect whether or not they are motivated in any particular set of circumstances. </p>
