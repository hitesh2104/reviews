    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">ESFJ's primary mode of living is externally focused, where they deal with issues according to how they feel about them, or how they fit in with their personal value system. ESFJ's secondary mode is internal, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are 'people' people   they love to be with and around other people. Being interested in others, they use their Sensing and Judging characteristics to gather detailed information which they use to support and uplift. Sincerely interested in others, as well as genuinely enjoying the company of other people, they are gifted in bringing out the best in others. Similarly, they like to be liked by others and are able to make people feel good about themselves.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are extremely good at reading others, and are able to understand their points of view through the use of their five senses. They are warm and energetic in their interpersonal relationships.</p></td>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are dependable and take their responsibilities seriously. Security and stability are important to them, and they have an ability to focus on the details of life. They are quick to identify what needs to be done and will make things happen.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are caring individuals and sometimes find it hard to accept difficult truths about those they love. They tend to depend on the positive feedback of others to feel validated and good about themselves. Being such caring people, ESFJs gain a lot of satisfaction from giving to and caring for others. They can be hurt by what they perceive to be the indifference of others. Being so good at reading others, they tend to change their manner to please those they are with in the moment. ESFJs have a strong need to be in control and will typically be first to initiate relationships.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are outspoken and have a strong moral code, which is normally defined by external influences such as the community in which they live or the organisation for which they work. They are thus able to express their opinions and the way they think things through should be with clarity, ease and self confidence. Those ESFJs growing up in a community with a strong value system that is ethical and centred around genuine goodness will most likely be kind, authentic and generous. ESFJs who have not had the opportunity to develop their own values with the support of a strong external value system, could most likely develop questionable values and might be at risk of wanting to control and manipulate others.</p>

<p class="body1">With an external world orientation, ESFJs have a natural tendency to want to control their environment. They feel comfortable with and demand structure and organisation, seeking closure. ESFJs work well in structured environments. The abstract, theoretical and impersonal holds no interest for them, and they enjoy creating order and structure much more. ESFJs are very good at tasks which require such skills.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs respect authority, rules and the law, will abide by it and believe that others should too. They're traditional, and prefer to do things in ways that have worked before, staying clear of unchartered territory. Having a need for security drives a ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of established systems. ESFJs should be aware that this tendency may cause the blind acceptance of rules without questioning or understanding them.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are skilled at anything to do with logistics, especially where people are involved, such as the service industry. Like the other SJs, they are masters at getting the right things in the right place in the right quantity at the right time to the right people. They are able to personalise any sales process, to such an extent that the customer feels they are buying from the ESFJ and not the company they represent.</p>
<p class="body1">ESFJs are sociable and outgoing, able to talk with anyone about anything, even more so when the focus is on events and problems, as opposed to abstractions and theories. They also make outstanding hosts and hostesses who are able to read the needs of others, promoting harmony in doing so.</p>
<p class="body1">ESFJs also contribute quantitative and standardising skills with an ability to look for that which works practically and is focused on people. ESFJs communicate easily and tend to be concrete and specific in their speech. Interested in facts and details, it is possible that they might overlook the subtle implications in conversation. With a linear thought process, ESFJs are good at providing detailed information especially towards describing the steps needed in completing tasks.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">It is important for ESFJs to have their own, as well as other people's physical needs, met. The preservation of life is important to them, as is the experience of comfort. If they know that their home base is safe, comfortable and happy, they work with ease and commitment. ESFJs have a need for roots, which is evident in their respect for tradition and an appreciation of home, and they tend to be loyal to organisations fulfilling this need.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs trust authority, put their faith in credentials and tend to work hard for those with the right qualifications and job titles. Likewise, they trust organisations with a good reputation, and a place where they can enjoy a sense of belonging. Membership is equally important to them and they like to be associated with and become involved in causes with merit. Organisations that offer the opportunity to serve and help others, hold a motivational value to the ESFJ. It is thus important to provide opportunities where ESFJs feel that they contribute to the well being of others, provided that they are acknowledged for their contributions.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs enjoy interaction with others and work well in an environment which holds the possibility to create and sustain social ties. They tend to make friends for life and derive a great deal of joy from lifelong associations (friends to them). Ownership is valued and reward can be geared towards this ESFJ need. They will preserve objects and property provided to them, taking care thereof with the necessary attention they believe it deserves. Thus ESFJs work well in a stable yet personal environment in which tasks are defined and everyone knows what is to be done, by whom and by when.</p>

<p class="body1">Any organisation paying attention to the ESFJ's concern about the future, particularly immorality and the disintegration of society, will win favour. Although they have an attitude of fatalism, they are also concerned about 'greater issues' impacting society.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs are naturally attracted to positions of responsibility and have a tendency to take accountability, even if they might not be at fault. Major changes and organisational transitions can be perceived as threatening, and it is recommended that assistance be given to ESFJs during such situations, especially if they think that problems are their responsibility.</p>

<p class="body1">To assist the optimal functional of the ESFJs, ambiguous situations should be minimised and resolved as quickly as possible. They prefer things to be definite and feel uncomfortable in situations where they don't know where they stand. Being anxious to please and to do the right thing, ESFJs don't know what is expected of them in ambiguous situations   which can be very upsetting.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>


<p class="body1">ESFJs learn best through the sequential, organised presentation of new information with examples and comparisons. They have an ability to accurately determine quantities, and excel at measurement. In fact, they prefer measurement to estimation and might even find estimations frustrating and limiting to their learning process. </p>

<p class="body1">Thus, when teaching complex processes, be sure to cover each step in sequence. Be careful not to move too quickly and conceptually, which is likely lead to confusion. Be sure to limit learning situations that anticipate more from the ESFJ than is quantitatively measureable. Their consciousness is concrete and specific, a place where they learn well though the use of logic, practical examples and experience.</p>



<h1>Management Style</h1>

<p class="body1">Respecting hierarchy, ESFJ managers expect others to follow suit. Their management style tends to be decisive and softly authoritarian, with an expectation that others will follow the rules and procedures without question (as they do). ESFJs manage in a personal manner, focusing on establishing and maintaining harmony in the organisation. They want people to fit in and feel comfortable, being part of and belonging to an organisation. In an ideal environment the ESFJ manager would like everyone to get along.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJ managers tend to pay attention to what people want and need. When they provide feedback, they tend to focus on getting subordinates back on course to correct any deviations from the standard. At times their feedback can be very blunt, and ESFJs need to learn that such feedback is most often perceived as criticism. They also need to learn that feedback is necessary and that the lack thereof can also be interpreted as criticism. As such it will aid productivity and innovation to provide more and positive feedback before a reprimand becomes necessary.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJ managers are conscientious about their responsibilities and tend to be orderly. They provide stability and follow acceptable social standards to do so. They tend to be sceptical of change and like to know its usefulness, practicality, past history (has it worked before) and social acceptability in order to gauge its use. As leaders, ESFJs are sometimes referred to as the "traditionalists" since they work to preserve tradition. The positive side is that they value rituals and ceremonies, creating opportunities for celebrations, which in turn provide a sense of belonging and permanence in the organisation. If no traditions exist, ESFJ managers are likely to create them.
</p> 

<p class="body1">ESFJ managers are dependable and good at follow through. They ensure that the right people and tools are in place to get the job done. They can benefit from creating an understanding of other preference types, especially those who do not enjoy the steady pace promoted by the ESFJ manager.</p>

<p class="body1">They may assume that they know what people want based on the norm, and might need to be reminded to invite subordinates to communicate what they really value. ESFJs managers tend to believe that appreciation must be earned and should not be given to those who are not worthy. They tend to only reward those in 'first, second and third places' sometimes overlooking the value others bring by taking more care in the completion of tasks and goals.</p>



<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>

<p class="body1">Being responsible and hard working, ESFJs are likely to be disappointed and upset when others do not follow through and things do not go well. As a result, they sometimes create the impression of being critical and distressed. Their basic attitude, one of fatalism where they believe things are what they are and little can be done to change them, can impact negatively on those around them. It could be useful to remind ESFJs that their impact on the people around them and the manner in which they decide to do so is a choice.</p>

<p class="body1">Being responsible and hard working, ESFJs frequently bring an abundance of energy to the completion of work. Their strong sense of responsibility may lead to them taking on too much work and becoming overburdened to the point of exhaustion. Becoming aware of this tendency, they should pay attention to their own needs in order to prevent burnout. Organisational assistance, in the form of official sanction, to take care of themselves before others are taken care of could assist greatly.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFJs work best in a steady, planned and paced manner. They may not always understand that other preference types work productively in bursts of energy. Becoming aware of this aspect could assist in them in not becoming impatient with the less steady pace of other types.</p>

<p class="body1">The ESFJs tendency towards fatalism makes them naturally resistant to change. It sometimes takes a great deal of energy to get ESFJs to support change, and it could be helpful to focus on showing them how a new state of stability can be obtained through change, a commodity the ESFJ values highly. It is also useful to point out to ESFJs how they obstruct change through their attitude.</p>

<p class="body1">In addition to their tendency to assume responsibility, ESFJs have a strong desire to please and provide for others, which again leads to them ignoring their own needs. Providing them with the ability to say 'no' can also assist a great deal in preventing over load.</p>
