<p>This report provides information on your personality preferences. It is based on the work of Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs, who in turn based the original Myers Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire on Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types.</p>
 <p>Sixteen distinct personality types have been identified, based on the combinations of the following four dimensions:</p><BR>
 <ul type="circle" style="margin:0 0 0 30px;">
 <li><B>Extraversion-Introversion</B>: A description of where individuals focus attention and from where they derive energy. An Extraversion preference indicates a focus on, and gaining of energy from, the outer world, while an Introversion preference focuses on and gains energy from the inner world of concepts, ideas and understanding.</li><BR>
 <li><B>Sensing-Intuition:</B> A description of how people prefer to absorb and make sense of information. Sensing is focused on what it real and actual, meaning a focus on facts which can be verified through the five senses of observation, whereas Intuition focuses on the identification of patterns and making sense of the meaning of information.</li><BR>
 <li><B>Thinking-Feeling:</B> A description of how people prefer to make decisions. A Thinking preference is based on logical analysis, whereas a Feeling preference is guided by a concern for the decision’s impact on others.</li><BR>
 <li><B>Judging-Perceiving:</B> A description of how people prefer to deal with the outer world. A Judging preference indicates a planned and orderly preference, whereas Perceiving indicates a flexible spontaneous preference.</li>
