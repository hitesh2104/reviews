    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">The INTP's primary mode of living is focused internally, where they deal with things rationally and logically. Their secondary mode is external, whereby they take things in primarily via Intuition.</p>

<p>The INTP's world is infused with theoretical possibilities. Everything is seen in terms of how it can be improved, or, alternatively what it can be turned into. They are gifted at analysing difficult problems identifying patterns, and coming to logical explanations, mostly where it can't be seen, in their own minds. Obtaining knowledge is important to them in assisting them in their quest for clarity. To some they appear 'absent-minded professors' who value intelligence and the ability to apply logic to theories in order to find solutions.</p>
<p class="body1">Much of their lives are conducted inside their heads, turning problems into logical explanations. Although they create the impression that they don't particularly care for the external world, they tend to feel personally responsible for solving theoretical problems to help society in moving towards a higher understanding. </p></td>

<p>INTPs love new ideas and enjoy abstractions and theories. When they discuss these concepts with others, it is easy to mistake them for extroverts. Others are quick to discover that most of their time is spent internally, working on the generation of new theories or to improve or disprove them. INTPs are especially gifted in objective analysis and prefer to build complex theoretical solutions as opposed to implementing systems. As such, they dislike routine work.</p>


<p class="body1">INTPs prefer to work with like-minded people and are not particularly attracted to leading or controlling others. They are flexible and tolerant, but can become very rigid if they feel that their firmly held beliefs are been violated or challenged. They tend to be shy when meeting new people, but can be very gregarious and self-confident around people that they know well (or when discussing theories or new ideas).</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs make decisions based on logical conclusions and find it difficult to apply subjective emotional considerations to decisions. As a result they are usually not in-tune with how other people feel and are not naturally well-equipped to meet their emotional needs. The INTP's Feeling side is their least developed trait, which might inhibit them in giving support and warmth in interpersonal relationships. Similarly, if they haven't developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may lose touch with their environment, sometimes neglecting routine maintenance tasks such as paying the bills or dressing appropriately.</p>

<p class="body1">Once an INTP had made a discovery, they attach importance to finding ways to express this succinctly and correctly. Absolute truths are important to them, and if they cannot find the words to describe their ideas to others they are unlikely to tailor the truth to explain it in an understandable manner to others. INTPs sometimes abandon projects once they have figured them out, excitedly moving on to the next thing. It's important that the INTP places importance on expressing their developed theories in ways that others can understand. In the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if they are the only person who understands it.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs might be described as unconventional, original and independent by other types. Traditional goals, popularity and security are not particularly important to them, and they tend to be temperamental and restless. Their unconventional thought patterns might alienate other types who have difficulty in understanding the INTP's fascination with the analysis of new ways of doing things. A lot of scientific breakthroughs are made by INTPs. Subsequently, INTPs work best when they are independent and enabled to focus on theory
creation, and excel in work environments that allow for their eccentricity. They are the pioneers of new thoughts in our society.</p>
<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<p class="body1">INTPs are good at strategy formulation; they map out all feasible events in advance, developing an action agenda and a well thought through outline for an overall scheme of their plan. They are able to quickly identify differences, and are good at developing categories, which makes them naturally attuned to analysis.
INTPs are good at building theoretical models and solving complex problems, enigmas and riddles. Although they are good at developing models, they are normally not that likely to implement their models. They tend to lose interest as soon as they have a full conceptual understanding of a situation. Best would be to consult with them during the implementation phase and to let them loose to design another system as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs make good architects; they are able to identify the most efficient and effective structure, while simultaneously being able to place the right parts in perspective, exactly where it will work best. INTPs use their imagination to design and they will generally define the tools and techniques needed to fulfil the design they have in mind. The ability to shape and create something of value and significance from nothing is probably their highest calling.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs have the ability to express exactly what they need to communicate, with precision and accuracy. They are known as 'wordsmiths' and they are able to spot contradictions and inconsistencies in the use of language. In fact they are so good at it that they can shred inconsistent views and arguments into tiny pieces.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs are applied best in situations where their skills, values and attitudes are directed to the acquisition of knowledge and competencies. They are always keen to learn and react well to challenges. As such they hunger for problems to solve, especially complicated ones. Within the organisation, their energy is directed toward change and the development of long range strategies to effect that change or the constant design of new products and revision of present ones. They function well in an environment that allows for logic, a calm atmosphere, justice, coherence and accuracy.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">INTPs function best in an environment where they can work with the theoretical, seek insight, understanding and obtain knowledge. They work well with others whom they respect and admire for their genius, efficiency and effectiveness. A space where they can conceptualise and analyse to their heart's content with the focus on precision, thought and language leads to great insight and theoretical development.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs do not react well to emotional response, rather placing trust and faith in the logical above all else. They also work best when they are on their own and allowed to operate autonomously. Do not expect them to react favourably to over-emotionality, exaggeration or the expression of unbridled imagination, all of which represent inaccuracy to them. They can nevertheless be team players if that is what is necessary to get the job done. They function optimally in a calm environment with the minimal amount of conflict.</p>
<p>In order to gain the INTP's support, it is important to prove the validity of new ideas with logical underpinnings and allow the INTP to ask questions. Although they are willing to explore and improve on whatever exists, their natural predisposition is that of scepticism. They also want to know the rationale behind an event or a policy before it can obtain their approval.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs are one of the few types who are comfortable with the ambiguous, and might even find it fascinating, spurring a search for clarity. There are however times when they can be overwhelmed by extreme ambiguity. Providing assistance by breaking the problem into workable parts should help a lot.
The ideal corporate structure is one where they are allowed to solve problems, conceptualise and have the opportunity to design, define, research and develop, without the interference of systems, procedures and day-to-day routine. INTPs do especially well in an environment that allows them to remain on a technical track, yet be rewarded as much as a manager. Actually, INTPs tend to be better leaders than managers. They enjoy the role of leader, where they can design new ways of effectiveness as opposed to merely been efficient.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs do well in competitive environments where the need for achievement is high. However, achievement is most often measured by internal and personal standards, not by society or the organisation. Thus INTPs thrive in spaces where there is ample opportunity to improve their competence, and they might even be spurred on by the fear of failure. Feedback is important, although INTPs are their own worst critics, normally already aware of their own shortcomings or mistakes. The INTP's standards for achievement are constantly escalating for self and others. There are times when it can be beneficial to gently remind INTPs of their exceedingly high expectations. INTPs respond positively to feedback from authority figures whom they perceive as knowledgeable and competent. They respond better to directives than orders. Best is to present them with information and to let them decide.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">INTPs learn by conceptualising, abstracting common properties and creating categories. They are adept at learning and comfortable with abstract ideas, but less skilled at learning by association or rote. When they feel overwhelmed by a fear of failure, the learning process can come to a complete standstill. Learning is a lifelong reality for the INTPs of the world, and if the formal requirements are below their expectations, they will evolve higher standards than those of the establishment or learning institution.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>


<p class="body1">INTPs are not particularly prone to pursuing managerial positions. Preferring autonomy and the opportunity to develop their natural skills and gifts as individuals, they tend to eschew managerial positions. When they do find themselves in managerial positions, they tend to be visionaries who communicate the general outline of their vision, yet allow everyone to 'do their own thing'.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs do not tolerate incompetence, and they are likely to take over rather than see a project fail. Their focus as managers is normally on the principles of the project or those on which the organisation is built.</p>

<p class="body1">INTP managers can be the best and the worst of communicators; they sometimes assume that they are understood and leave out essential aspects of their vision, unintentionally leaving subordinates in the dark. A strong dislike for redundancy can sometimes prevent them from stating what they perceive to be the obvious. They are though masterful in the use of language and can use extremely precise word choices to explain themselves when communicating. Their need to express themselves can sometimes become so technical and so complex that others may have difficulty in understanding them, especially the less conceptual individual.</p>

<p class="body1">INTPs are embarrassed by praise, both in giving and receiving it, and often overlook the need for positive feedback. Driven by they own internal standards, they wrongly assume that others are too. INTP managers could learn from other types, especially the ENFP, to develop more patience towards errors and to assist individuals to get back on track.</p>
<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>


<p class="body1">In their search for objective truth and understanding, INTPs often overlook the human element. When they perceive others to be incompetent or making mistakes, INTPs can be sarcastic and bitingly critical, and might even be perceived as cold and distant. They do not intentionally neglect or overlook the human element, but would do well to occasionally shift their attention to the Feeling side, especially if they need to work with and through others to achieve their goals. INTPs are intellectual snobs, with little patience for those less endowed with abstract intelligence. Developing an appreciation for the strengths of other types can assist in developing greater understanding for the needs of other types of intelligences.</p>

<p class="body1">When an INTP does what they love best, i.e. designing and planning, they can become fixated on the planning phase, even delaying the actual doing of a project. Give them a deadline for work to be completed and, if possible, provide an action-orientated SP to assist. INTPs do not particularly like or favour implementation; they need to be reminded to stay around for the implementation of their projects or suffer disappointment when the results don't meet their high standards.</p>

<p class="body1">If an INTP finds that 'small talk' or 'chit-chat' is really important to their jobs, it is helpful to provide them with an ENFJ model from whom they can learn.
Creativity is very important to INTPs and they will do better to work for democratic institutions that value their strategic flair and love for design.</p>
