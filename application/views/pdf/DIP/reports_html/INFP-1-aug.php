    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">primary mode of living is internally focused, where they deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into their personal value system. Their secondary mode is external, where they take things in primarily via their intuition.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs main focus is on making the world a better place, more so than any other intuitive Type. Their purpose is focused on finding out the meaning of life. Idealistic and perfectionistic in nature, they drive themselves and others in a quest to achieve the goals they have identified. They are gifted at and excel at intuitive reading abilities related to people. These are used to guide them in combination with a continued search for value in life. They will stop at nothing to accumulate and to investigate knowledge which leads to help themselves and others to make the world a better place.
</p>

<p> Been authentic and sincere often leads to the INFP been counted as a valued friend and true confidant. They prefer to and are able to express warmth to those they know well.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs tend to shy away from conflict, the emotion it elicits is not a comfortable space and they will expand great amounts of energy to avoid it. They approach conflict situations from a feeling perspective and place little importance on who might be right and who might be wrong. At times INFPs create the impression of being illogical or even irrational in conflict situations. The flip side is that this trait makes them outstanding mediators with an ability to intuitively understand people's feelings and perspectives, which makes them good at solving people conflicts.</p>

<p class="body1">Although INFPs are flexible and laid-back individuals, they are strongly values focused and can become aggressive defenders of a cause if they identify with it. A tendency exists to perceive a project or a job as a cause once they are interested in it. Although their natural preference is to focus on the global view, they will turn no stone unturned to dig into the details once they are committed to a cause.
</p>
<p class="body1">Don't be surprised to find an INFP removing a speck of dust from their iPad project device and ignoring a wine stain on the carpet. The mundane details of life are normally ignored, basically because they focus such amounts of energy on those things that really interest them, that they rest is forgotten or ignored.
With a focus on their feelings, INFPs prefer not to deal with logic and the hard facts. Being so focused on the Human Condition makes it difficult for them to deal with emotionally devoid judgment. As a result, INFPs might be difficult to argue with unless they have developed the ability to be logical. When under great stress, they sometimes reveal the opposite side of their personality and tend to use facts in an inaccurate and illogical manner.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs set high standards for themselves and others, mostly they are hard on themselves and often do not give themselves credit for their contributions. Their standards are likely higher than others which makes it difficult for them to work on a project within a group context. In order to be comfortable with their purpose in life, INFPs will do well to balance their high ideals with the requirements of every day living.</p>

<p class="body1">Like the INFJs, INFPs are likely to be good at writing. Where they sometimes find it difficult to express themselves verbally, the written word provides them with an opportunity to express and define what they feel on paper. This is due to the INFPs introverted nature, if provided with the opportunity to go 'inward' they are easier able to identify and express their strong emotions in a fluid and expressive manner.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs are often to be found in the social services professions, such as teaching and counselling. With their focus on making the world a better place, some of the great, humanistic catalysts in the world have been INFPs.</p>
<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">INFPs are well applied in working with others in the workplace, although they generally create the impression that they keep a psychological distance. This distance is due to the INFPs supporting process being internal, with a desire to develop the full potential of whom ever they come into contact with. They excel at listening to, facilitating, deploying, and training, motivating, recruiting as well as counselling others. INFPs do better in small groups and one-on-one relationships. They are able to identify what the other person needs and will provide accordingly.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs can become advocates and champions of other people or an organisations cause. They are particularly good at identifying overtones, hidden agendas and making inferences of others' behaviour. In supporting a greater cause, they are able to submerge themselves into a rich inner world of feelings and intuition, tuning out additional insights and data to gain more insight into who ever of what ever the chose to support.</p>

<p class="body1">Although they tend to want to perfect verbal communication, they are good at written communication and have a flair for global and metaphoric expression. With a preference for identifying causes to support, INFPs excel at investigative journalism. Their ability to understand how people function often leads to careers perusing and using this ability.</p>
<p>INFPs make loyal employees, as long as there is an understanding that this loyalty is directed more towards the people in the organisation, than the organisation itself. They enjoy variety and can work with various projects going simultaneously. INFPs are patient with complicated situations and are able to concentrate intensely and with dedication to achieve results that are significant and important to them. As can be expected, their skills will focus on the observation and accumulation of accurate information about the beliefs, sentiments, norms, values and problems that others tend to shy away from.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs are normally ethically and morally driven employees, the 'greater good' is very important to them. They will naturally be on the lookout for violations to human rights and can become direct a great deal of energy to 'putting things right'. As such they are highly intolerant of dishonesty and fraud and will tend to be whistle blowers   automatically guarding over the deeds of other employees.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs handle the ambiguous well, been observers of the paradoxes between organisational and human needs. They will nevertheless support and direct a great deal of energy toward brining out the potential in all those touching their lives. Being so focused on finding their own identity, they are good at facilitating the same process for others. Their highest goal that of optimising personal insights and self-knowledge is often directed to others and their search for meaning.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs, with their well developed observational skills, are able to detect variations related to the deterioration or improvement of performance in others. This is a unique skill and not easily available to other types. Within the organisation, this gift is normally directed toward change and aiming at making it a better place for individuals to work. As such, INFPs make good co-operators, driven to seek harmony and good will, always focused on creating conditions for comfortable people-environments.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>

<p class="body1">The INFPs appreciation is directed at human accomplishment, and they work well in an environment where they are allowed to express their appreciation of others and be appreciated in turn. They are always alert to situations that might bring out the best in others. It is also important to provide opportunities for authentic and quality interaction with others. INFPs view management by the book, systems, criticism or some kind of edict as detrimental to the optimisation of human potential and will naturally it. As such harmony is important for optimal performance, and they may become demoralised in environments with strive and high turn over.</p>
 
 <p class="body1">A work environment that is perceived to be meaningful and harmonious brings out the best in INFPs. They are driven by an internal value system and can become apathetic in a space that is perceived to be impersonal, immoral or not caring for the well being of employees. Meaningful relationships are those which provide opportunity for development and growth. INFPs value integrity and rely a great deal on their intuition. If they find themselves in a work space that does not allow intuitive insight and focus too much on logic and reasoning, the INFP will become withdrawn and unhappy. They normally do well if they can trust their intuition and sometimes battle with decision making focused on facts and data.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs work best in small groups and with other individuals. They tend to find interaction with a great number of people unproductive, threatening and disruptive. Manipulative approaches from others are not well received and this type of influencing technique will most likely be met with a silent, determined and unwavering wall of resistance. Working in a caring environment, focused on a desire to support and assist people brings great joy and fulfilment and is where INFPs are well applied in the organisational system. In order to deliver a great performance, the INFP needs to be convinced that jobs provide opportunities for the fostering of harmony, wholeness and the mental health of others.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs are able to focus their energy on something they care about, even tasks which might not focus on their strong diplomatic skills. Small groups, where they have the opportunity to get to know and trust others bring out the best in them. It might also be beneficial to create opportunities for INFPs to communicate their convictions and thoughts on paper and to provide them with learning opportunities that can teach them to speak up. As such they can be assisted to communicate the intensity of what they feel, something that they find difficult in doing verbally.</p>

<p class="body1">Thus, programmes and ideas focused on helping others, that provides opportunities for meaningful interaction and being able to communicate their philosophical ideals in small, intimate groups, are really beneficial to the overall functioning of INFPs in work situations. They work well for superiors they perceive to be authentic, ethical and 'good'. Authority is earned through exemplary behaviour focused on the 'greater good' for all. They will naturally tend to respect those in positions of authority, and seek their approval; however, they do react well to harsh criticism. INFPs might even find it devastating due to their search for perfection and being aware of that which they do wrong or may fall short of. Receiving positive, caring and genuine feedback, aimed at the personal development of the INFP, is constructive. As mentioned, INFPs prefer a harmonious environment and do not function optimally in situations of conflict. Providing an opportunity to talk through the conflict and allowing time for reflection can assist in the process of resolving conflict.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">INFPs react well to lectures and written information, which is perceived to be important and of value. They are abstract learners and enjoy being exposed to new ideas and concepts, especially in the human sciences fields. They like to understand the causes and events and are able to see relationships which they synthesise easily to simplify the learning process.</p>

<p class="body1">INFPs do not learn optimally from association and rote and do better in spaces where they can use their imagination freely. They learn well from abstract ideas and are comfortable with theories. With a preference to focus on global impressions, they sometimes overlook the importance of what is perceived to be mundane, inconsequential details. It could assist them to persevere and to gain more insight to detail, especially where their jobs depend on it.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>

<p class="body1">The INFPs management style is democratic, participative and caring. They are likely to be people orientated, and will seek and provide developmental opportunities for those reporting into their positions. Don't be surprised if an INFP manager identifies other positions for their staff even if it means losing a worth while contributor to the group. As such they are able to champion worthwhile causes for others aimed at assisting them to achieve whatever they set out to do.</p>

<p class="body1">Although they can be great champions for others, INFP managers lead in a personal, quite and unassuming manner. They tend to get to know other individuals in the organisations, normally on a one on one basis and by systematically establishing personal relationships that are meaningful to them. The development of staff takes precedence over rules, systems and procedures. They are much more likely to ask if a proposed change will be good for 'the people' before they commit to its execution. Like the INFJ, they are likely to be concerned about the rate of the change, how it is communicated by the organisation and whether or not it is accepted by employees. They don't react particularly well to 'announcements' that needs to be followed against all odds and will tend to take the employee side if such an event occurs.
INFP managers are well aware and accept that nothing is constant and they will use their influence in a quite and unobtrusive manner to influence a cause in a positive and constructive manner   provided it's for the 'greater good of all'.</p>

<p class="body1">Being so attuned to the emotions and motivations of others, they are naturally gifted at understanding individual differences between people. This ability is used to identify optimal work matches for those under their care.</p>
