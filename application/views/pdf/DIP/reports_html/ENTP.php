<p class="body1">The ENTP's primary mode of living is externally focused, where information in taken in through Intuition. ENTP's secondary mode is internally focused, where they prefer to deal with issues in a logical and rational manner. With Extraverted Intuition as the primary driving force, they are interested in understanding life and the world they occupy. The ENTP and ENFT types develop a deep understanding of their environment, more so than the other types.</p>
<p class="body1">The ability to intuitively read situations, as well as people, has distinct advantages. They have a tendency to understand and come to grips with the world around them quickly and in great depth. This makes them flexible, with an ability to adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They tend to be good at almost anything that interests them.</p>
<p class="body1">As they develop the ability to trust their intuition, which in turn creates new possibilities, they become resourceful problem solvers. In essence, ENTPs tend to be 'ideas' people, and, being perceptive, they see possibilities all around them.</p>

<p class="body1">Their enthusiasm tends to be contagious, enabling them to motivate support for their visions and ideas. ENTPs are less interested in the development of plans and actions steps to follow through on their ideas, and might even experience this as being inconvenient. Consequently they may complete little of what they start. In order to follow through with their plans, ENTPs need to develop their Thinking process by fully thinking through ideas in order to take advantage of them.</p>

<p class="body1">The ENTP's supplementary process of Introverted Thinking drives their ability to make decisions. This enables them to follow a rational and logical approach in reaching conclusions related to the absorption of information. As such, their Thinking orientation can assist a great deal when it is applied to their Intuitive perceptions, resulting in effective outcomes.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTPs are primarily driven to understand and size up situations. Their ability to logically view and analyse problems may, in some instances, be to their detriment, isolating them from their own feelings as well as those of others. The least preferred preference (that of Sensing Feeling) could result in them neglecting to take care of the details in their lives. As a result, they could give the impression that they do not value the input of others and might even be perceived as being aggressive or blunt.
</p>
<p class="body1">
The opposite can sometimes be observed when an ENTP is under pressure. The possibility then exists that they might become so obsessed with minor details that they lose their ability to generate possibilities and look for solutions. As can be imagined, this causes great distress to an ENTP, whereas because they normally have the ability to focus on the bigger picture, they now tend to become bogged down in unimportant detail. An aware ENTP could use this information to recognise that they are under pressure, and make adjustments to revert to their preferred mode of functioning.</p>

<p class="body1">In general, ENTPs are upbeat visionaries. Much of their time is spent in seeking higher understanding and they truly value knowledge. They become excited about what is possible, and focus with ease on challenges, difficulties and concepts. As such, they are good at developing and creating solutions and solving problems.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ENTPs primarily bring problem solving competence and skills to the workplace. They prefer to, and work well, in moving from one project to the next with an ability to solve major problems, preferably leaving the details to others. They have a need to solve problems, especially complex ones.
</p>

<p class="body1">ENTPs are particularly skilled at analysis, being able to create categories and identify differences. The efficiency they bring to the workplace can be compared to that of an engineer. They are able to map out all feasible possibilities in advance, with a well thought through outline of an overall scheme of what they have in mind. They are also flexible, with an ability to improvise and adapt as they go along. As such, ENTPs are fascinated by riddles and enigmas, with a natural ability to build theoretical models and solve complex problems. Behind these skills is a constant awareness of the structure of a situation or relationship.</p>


<p class="body1">As ENTPs respond to external processes and are able to devise techniques and tools as a means to an end. ENTPs can retain several issues in their minds at the same time, and are even able to talk about them simultaneously. The reason is simple: they have a unique ability to multi focus. They are adept at improvising an expedient solution to a problem as the situation develops. Behind this skill is a constant awareness of the structure of the situation, relationship or edifice.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTPs are precise in their speech. They are skilful conversationalists who communicate in an entertaining fashion, and are able to hold the attention of others. Their speech is normally filled with wit and play on words. They are able to track complex verbalisations, with a gift to notice inconsistencies in language, pick up contradictions and observe shifts in position. They have an ability to debate both sides of an argument, sometimes creating the impression that they might be opposed to their own position.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTPs crave achievement. The success of their work is measured against their own standards and not those set by the organisation or society at large. They have high expectations of themselves and others, constantly escalating their standards of performance. Energy is directed to and focused on the ever present acquisition of knowledge and competencies. Change is important to them, especially if the change is directed to the development of long range strategies or the constant design of new products and revision of present ones.</p>




<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">ENTPs work best in a calm, controlled atmosphere, where justice, accuracy and coherence prevail.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTPs are good at generating solutions to complex problems; therefore they function well in an environment where they have an opportunity to improve on current solutions and create new ones. Intellectually challenging projects energise and bring out the best in their skill set. Allow them opportunities to talk through their theories and visions which assist the creative process. It could be beneficial to provide the ENTP the freedom to play 'what if' games and to argue both sides of a problem at the same time. Do not demand ENTPs to implement every detail of a solution, as this is not necessarily their strong suit; the ideal is to employ them to continuously design solutions to problems. Once they have engaged in solving problems, provide them with the opportunity to find solutions without unnecessary interruption as this could have a negative influence on their productivity.</p>


<p class="body1">ENTPs are good at identifying and focusing on projects, and should ideally be employed on project related activities. It is also appropriate to allow them to work on more than one project simultaneously, provided they have the 'mental horse power' to deal with the complexity of the tasks involved. The more balls they have in the air at the same time, the better   even though at times one or two priorities may slip.</p>

<p class="body1">Realise that ENTPs tend to be global; they want to understand and comprehend the total situation before delving into details. Providing an opportunity for a hands on assessment assists in gaining their interest and buy in regarding involvement. Finding the ambiguous fascinating normally activates the need to seek clarity.

<p class="body1">In order to capitalise on feedback opportunities, it is best to take the ENTP's need for achievement into account. They are critical of their own work and will normally be aware of where they made mistakes, as well as their shortcomings, long before anyone else has informed them. They tend to value confrontation as a valuable learning experience. ENTPs constantly seek opportunities to learn, and it is therefore best to provide these as opposed to dealing with a derailed or possible depressed ENTP.</p>


<p class="body1">Working in an environment where competition is valued energises ENTPs, even if the competition is 'just for fun'. Some ENTPs might value the opportunity to play the game even more than necessarily winning.</p>


<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>


<p class="body1">ENTPs learn best through conceptualising and identifying abstract common properties and developing categories. They are adept at assimilating abstract ideas, and learning through rote should be avoided. Their fear of failure can sometimes be a great stumbling block, limiting the impact of learning opportunities. At times they might even create the impression that they 'know it all' in order to protect themselves. When this fear becomes overwhelming, or when they feel out of their depth, they might even go as far as to pretend that they are competent, when in fact they are not. It is therefore important to provide a safe environment where they are allowed to communicate their fears.</p>



<h1>Management Style</h1>


<p class="body1">The management style of the ENTP is likely to be that of a visionary who communicates the general outline of the vision, yet allowing others to plan and do their own work. ENTPs prefer to operate autonomously, and they generally assume that others do too. Typically project orientated, they can become obsessed or totally immersed in an assignment or activity that they enjoy. As a result they are good at mobilising others to kick start projects and will take the initiative to take action if needed.</p>

<p class="body1">Having high standards for themselves and likewise setting them for subordinates, they sometimes rationalise that praise may be redundant and obvious, to such an extent that they neglect to provide feedback and praise. This could also be because ENTPs feel embarrassed by praise, both receiving and providing it to others.</p>

<p class="body1">Keenly aware of the inner workings of the whole organisation, their focus as managers is on the principles of the project or those on which the organisation is built. Although they prefer to work autonomously, ENTPs can be team players for periods of time if that is what it takes to get the job done. Their prime focus is on efficiency.
</p>
<p class="body1">Ultimately, ENTPs prefer to be in charge of innovative projects in which they can ignore standard and traditional approaches and be creative. They are most productive in an environment which allows them to adapt and 'make do' with whatever is at hand rather than insist on a carefully drawn up blueprint/s in advance.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development</h1>

<p class="body1">From a work perspective, ENTPs need to choose their work environment carefully. With a tendency to get bored with day to day driven routine, they are known to attempt to dispel the monotony in creative ways not always conducive to the organisation.</p>

<p class="body1">As managers, ENTPs need to become aware of their hesitancy to provide others with feedback. Coaching can assist them in developing appropriate means to show appreciation for others. Once they can see that praise is needed, and become aware that is has practical value, it could become easier to provide it. Although their vision might seem clear to them, it will also be helpful to explain the details thereof to others in order to obtain their buy in and assistance in related matters.</p>

<p class="body1">ENTPs therefore have a tendency to overlook the human element in their quest for objective truth and understanding. They may sometimes be perceived as being sarcastic and critical, creating the impression that they are aloof and cold. It would help other types to know that this is not deliberate and inconsiderate behaviour, but rather the direct impact of an ENTP's ability and preference to focus on tasks, especially when they are enthusiastic and involved in the excitement of what they are doing. Their enthusiasm can also cause an oversight of detail, which might appear inconsequential in the moment, but prove to be significant later on.
</p>
<p class="body1">Although they are open to other's ideas, ENTPs tend to be sceptical. They will typically look for information to validate their impressions until proven wrong. This tendency can create the impression that they are negative or critical. It is therefore important to become aware of the impact this attitude might have on others and to adjust where necessary. ENTPs prefer theory and design as opposed to reality and implementation, and they might resist continuation to spend more time on design. The likelihood also exists that they might be disappointed when the end result does not meet their high expectations. It would assist ENTPs to obtain assistance in clarifying their priorities, not only for themselves but also for others. In this way, they can manage their own expectations and see the result of their design and ideas in final format.</p>
