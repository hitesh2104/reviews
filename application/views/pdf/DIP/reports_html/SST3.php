<h1>SST LEVEL 3 - STRATEGY EXECUTION</h1>
<img src="/images/cap_future.jpg" />
<p>It seems that they should find it comfortable working in environments that offer some strategic involvement, more specifically the execution of strategic plans. Thinking things through and effectively using and distributing resources effectively is a main component of this level which they should be able to perform effectively. They probably know how the operational day-to-day activities link to the long term strategy of the organisation. </p>
<p>Leaders on this level are usually leaders of others, at times leader of other first-line managers and/or supervisors. </p>
