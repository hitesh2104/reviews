    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">ISTP's primary mode of living is internally focused, where they deal with things in a rational and logical manner. Their secondary mode is external, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTPs like to figure out and understand how things work. They excel at logical analysis and like to apply their findings in practical terms. They are able to reason well, although they are not necessarily interested in concepts and theories, unless they can be practically applied. As a result they like to take things apart in order to figure out how they work.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTPs are action orientated and the type most likely to spend time in adventure orientated activities such as surfing or skydiving. They are attracted to mechanical 'things', such as planes, trains and automobiles, and like to 'tinker' and look at them in order to make them work. ISTPs are independent, and they need time and space to make decisions that are important to them. They are not fond of rules and regulations as these might inhibit the freedom they cherish to make their own decisions. They tend to get bored easily, always seeking action and adventure.</p>

<p class="body1">Although ISTPs are independent, they are also known to be loyal to that which they believe in and feel that others should be treated with fairness and equality. As such they can become strong supporters of a cause once they believe in it. Their code of conduct is internally regulated, and although they might not respect the 'system's' guidelines, they tend to be true to their own. It is unlikely for an ISTP to go against their own rules.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs absorb a lot of impersonal facts from the external world, and they need and prefer to spend time alone in order to make sense of and sort the sensory information they accumulate. They do not necessarily enjoy desk bound jobs and prefer to be 'doing' things. They are inclined to be spontaneous and react to the sensory input they receive. They normally have strong technical orientated skills and like to focus on the details of practical applications. They are able to make quick and effective decisions based on information provided to them in the moment.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTPs are not naturally attuned to their own emotions or those of other people. Neither do they like making decisions based on value judgements and might sometimes find it difficult to deal with strong emotions. In some instances, especially where the Feeling side is neglected, it is not uncommon for the ISTP to experience problems in this area.</p>

<p class="body1">When under extreme stress, the ISTP creates the impression of rash emotional outbursts of anger, or might even feel overwhelmed by emotions and feelings they normally prefer to ignore. If they are compelled to share these strong emotions, ISTPs often express themselves awkwardly, and the possibility exists that they may be misunderstood.</p>

<p class="body1">However, in peak conditions the ISTP excels at crisis situations. Due to their action orientated preference, they tend to make good athletes and are sometimes known for their outstanding hand-eye coordination. They like to and will strive for project completion, and are normally responsible for 'tying up loose ends'. ISTPs tend to be patient with others, unless they are under stress which can lead to emotional outbursts.</p>


<p class="body1">In general, ISTPs create the impression of optimistic, positive individuals who are loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their desires, and trusting of others with a strong need for independence and freedom.</p>
<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<p class="body1">ISTPs bring an optimistic outlook to the workplace. They operate from a perspective that everything will turn out for the better and are good at and like to take risks. They excel at anything to do with tools, and bring great talent to mechanical and technical endeavours. As such they become virtuosos at operating mechanical 'instruments' such as operating equipment, weapons, tools and all kinds of instruments.
</p>
<p class="body1">Situations, materials and machines are expertly operated, to such an extent that minute changes can be done with skill and flair. They are normally the type that can best utilise any resource available to get the job done. As such they are very creative and sometimes unconventional in their approach to make things work, especially if they perceive it to be a challenge.
</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs excel at concrete communication and will provide the necessary information to allow others to complete their work. But, don't expect them to talk a lot, unless they are talking about an area of interest. They are then able to provide as much detail as possible, with the added lexicon associated with their area of interest. The majority of their communication will be to the point and directed at explaining and creating concrete and realistic images.
</p>
<p class="body1">The ISTP is good at identifying variations and opportunities as they are very observant. At times they know what needs to be done even before they have really thought about a problem. They do well in environments that provide opportunities for variation, spontaneity and action. As such they are able to direct their energy toward impactful performance. Being provided with the opportunity to solve here and now problems enables them to sustain their energy sources. They are able to pace themselves and rarely experience fatigue. They thus excel in spaces where their energy is directed toward expedient action, finding short cuts and quickly fixing things.
</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs are not people focused and will not 'waste' their energy on the emotions and interpersonal problems of others. They seem to be content finding practical solutions to unusual and difficult problems, in combination with finding ways to do so as quickly as possible.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>

<p class="body1">ISTP employees do well in an environment that provides change and opportunities to take risks. Their risk taking is normally calculated and they do well in situations where they need to look for effective and speedy solutions to problems in the moment. As such they feel that they make an important and memorable contribution to the space they work in.</p>
<p class="body1">Providing opportunities to achieve the 'impossible' brings out the performer in the ISTP, and they are capable of delivering action-filled, magnificent performances. They are motivated to achieve the impossible, preferably in the present moment. Such opportunities bring out their natural abundant sources of energy, and they will direct this energy to the achievement of a state of perfection on specific assignments.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs work best in situations that allow for autonomy and the opportunity to make things function, and function well. They are also gifted in situations where they are allowed to use their five senses to create solutions. As such they appreciate and are good at anything to do with aesthetics, such as blending colours or creating gastronomic experiences.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs are most engaged when their actions are self-directed and applied to co-ordination and tool related tasks. These instruments typically become an extension for their creative abilities. They excel at both simple and complex tasks, and are able to direct their energies with vigour to anything from creating and shaping an artistic object, to acting effectively in crisis situations.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTPs are normally as active in their private lives as they prefer to be in their work spaces. It is a good idea to provide opportunities for their other activities, such as sport and the outdoors, which normally provide additional energy for work-related tasks.</p>
<p class="body1">Those in positions of power and management function well when they are respected and obeyed, especially if they think they have earned their right in the hierarchy through hard work and example. ISTPs respond well to those in authority who are competent, are perceived as action orientated and who have demonstrated their superior capabilities. As such they respect and value proven performance beyond anything else. ISTPs work best in environments where anxiety and personal tension is minimal. A likelihood exists that they
will leave conflict situations and might resist getting to the source of the conflict. As interpersonal skills are not necessarily a skill, they may feel it a waste of time dealing with and trying to understand interpersonal conflict.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">As can be expected, ISTPs learn best through practical, hands-on methods. The react better to seeing something rather than being told what to do. They like exploring how to decipher things and, as a result, prefer not to use manuals. When they do observe, they pay attention and tend to retain that which they learn.</p>

<p class="body1">Being so reactive to the visual and practical, ISTPs often have difficulty with abstract presentations of learning material. They live in the moment and do not like to study theory or spend too much time engaged in 'book learning'. They do best where they can follow an example allowing them to quickly learn new, practical skills. In order for learning to be valued, the ISTP would like to have a practical, here and now use for the information they receive. They require immediate results and like to learn new things that they can apply immediately.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
<p class="body1">ISTPs manage in a democratic, expedient and pragmatic manner. ISTP managers are able to divert their energies to assist subordinates to get the job done, with the least amount of effort. They act quickly and effectively in crisis situations and manage in an action-orientated fashion. They tend to prioritise tasks above people, and value variety in what they do. They especially like not knowing the outcome of what they do, bringing their creativity to the fore.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTP managers are able to assist employees with finding solutions to concrete problems and prefer to do it as effectively and as quickly as possible, in the moment. ISTP managers are flexible, more so than the other structured managers. They are also able to change position if a new solution will work better and more effectively. Although they are flexible and ready to look for new solutions, ISTP managers tend to resist systems, routines and procedures which do not assist in providing immediate solutions. As a result they are likely to 'cut through red tape' if necessary. They are normally better at improving and following their own procedures. If they detect a malfunction or an operational problem, they are capable of mobilising whatever resources and material is necessary to correct the problem.</p>
<p class="body1">Perfection is important to them and they can be quite harsh on those who do not live up to their high standards. They will do well to consider the human element when managing others.</p>
<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>
<p class="body1">A focus on getting things done and quick response times can sometimes be positioned against the needs of people. ISTP will do well to include the perceptions of others as 'factors' to be considered prior to taking action. They could also benefit from exercising and developing a skill to listen to the ideas and suggestions of others. The ISTP's need for autonomy and freedom can be the source of great scrutiny in more orderly, structured and predictable environments, and they might find themselves punished for their preference.</p>
<p class="body1">With their focus on finding quick solutions in the present, the ISTP employee is likely to overlook the long-term effects of their solutions, and can also be a great source of frustration to those who prefer to take more time to deliberate solutions. Some work environments might even perceive ISTPs to be too impulsive and as not responsible enough to take on certain tasks. They may also not be welcomed in organisations that value tradition, predictability and dependence. To these types of organisations, the ISTP's tendency to identify problems to treat may be the opposite of the stabilising influence they value and look for in their employees.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTPs do not take kindly to negative environments, which could cause them to ignore problems, especially those of an interpersonal nature. Their focus and attention on the details and concrete tasks sometimes desensitises them to becoming aware of the more subtle factors in group behaviour and interpersonal relationships. They could ask for assistance from other types to identify the more abstract thoughts and feelings of others, and to react in a responsive manner to conflict situations. As such they can guard against the impression that they are cold, impersonal and purely task-orientated individuals. Mostly, they are mistakenly judged to be such, when they actually do care.</p>
