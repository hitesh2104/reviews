    <p>The Matrix of Intellectual Reasoning Assessment (MIRA)is a non-verbal mental ability test that requires test-takers to find solutions to a range of different problems. It measures observation skills, thinking ability, intellectual capacity and efficiency. It also measures one's ability to formulate new concepts, extract meaning out of ambiguity and to think clearly about complex situations and events.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The Stratified Systems Theory (SST) developed by Eliot Jaquesdefines work in different organisationallevels, mainly on the basis of decision-making complexity. MIRA measures the individual's ability to find solutions through different levels of complex problems.</p>

<h1>SST LEVEL 3 – STRATEGY EXECUTION</h1>

<p>It seems that they should find it comfortable working in environments that offer some strategic involvement, more specifically the execution of strategic plans. Thinking things through and effectively using and distributing resources effectively is a main component of this level which they should be able to perform effectively. They probably know how the operational day-to-day activities link to the long term strategy of the organisation.</p>
<p>Leaders on this level are usually leaders of others, at times leader of other first-line managers and/or supervisors.</p>
