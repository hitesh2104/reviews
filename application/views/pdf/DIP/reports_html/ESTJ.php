    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">ESTJ's primary mode of living is externally focused, where they deal with issues as rationally and logically as possible. Their secondary mode is internal, where they take things in via the five senses in an exact and precise fashion.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs prefer to function in a world of logic, facts and concrete needs. They have the ability to live in the present, and tend to scan the environment to ensure that everything is running smoothly and steadily. They respect laws and tradition, and follow a clear set of beliefs and standards. ESTJs tend to expect the same of others, and are inclined to be intolerant of those who do not have the same belief in these systems. Competency and efficiency is valued, and they prefer to see quick returns on their efforts.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs like to take the initiative and are often described as 'take charge' individuals. They have a clear vision of the way they want things and how they should be, which predisposes them to leadership positions. In their aim to reach their objectives, they create the impression of being somewhat aggressive, yet self confident individuals.</p>

<p> Their main talent lies in devising systems and plans of action, and they are able to identify the steps necessary to complete specific tasks. Being focused and task orientated, they may be perceived as being critical and demanding, and do not hesitate to express discomfort when others do not meet their standards. Their criticism is normally valid, straight forward and to the point.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs have a natural sense of duty, and they take their commitments seriously. They enjoy people interaction and like to participate in social events focused around the community, work or the family. Regardless of their serious nature, they like to have fun, although they shy away from the feeling, intimate side of interactions, preferring the world of logic and reasoning.</p>

<p class="body1">Security is important to ESTJs. They will go out of their way to uphold social order and will contribute their energy toward the enhancement and promotion of these goals. They will likewise be committed to those issues they find worthwhile, whether this be in their work or personal lives. Typical descriptive words for ESTJs are: realistic, dependable, practical and conscientious. Goals that fall outside of their practical scope will not receive the same attention or devotion. It is important for them to feel connected to a cause to a goal. Once they have seen and understood its importance, they will spare no any effort to incorporate this into their quest for clarity and security.</p>


<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ESTJs are highly gifted and skilled at anything to do with logistics. Their ability to get the right things in the right place in the right quantity and the right quality at the right time and to the right people is exceptional. In striving to achieve their own high standards, they tend to be tough on others, but even tougher on themselves. They will therefore set high standards and expectations with the promise to deliver exceptional work.</p>

<p class="body1">With a clear preference to focus on the present, ESTJs are action orientated. As such they like to get things done as efficiently and economically as possible, within organisational systems and procedures. They do not enjoy theoretical work and abstract concepts   which are best left to others. They are able to make things work, and make them work well. ESTJs are gifted at implementation and are best applied in this fashion. Thus their energy is best directed towards completion. ESTJ's plans are normally executed with precision and they are good at monitoring subordinates to adhere to set procedures. They are decisive and realistic, and will provide exact instructions.</p>

<p class="body1">
When working with policies and procedures, their focus will be to make necessary adjustments to enhance overall efficiency. ESTJs are able to provide specific, detailed and relevant information in their communication with co workers. They are able to identify and articulate the specific steps needed to achieve a specific outcome or goal. Their thought process is linear, and they tend to focus and direct thoughts toward problem solution in a step by step linear fashion.</p>


<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">ESTJs work well in a predictable, stable and orderly environment where tasks are defined and allocated, and where everyone knows what is expected of them. They function well where they are expected to adhere to time schedules and precisely defined tasks. An environment driven by stability and predictability brings out their best performance. ESTJs do not like surprises and tend to be wary of change. They will nevertheless buy into change more readily if they can see the usefulness and practical implications thereof.</p>


<p class="body1">Tradition is important to ESTJs, mainly because it represents a sense of belonging, pride and recognition. They are attracted to organisations with a proud heritage and are known for their manifestation of success. They will thus work diligently for and with loyalty for such an institution. Belonging to and experiencing a sense of camaraderie within a work group is also important to ESTJs. Memberships to groups and being a member of an organisation provides a sense of stability and belonging, preserving and enhancing the lifestyle ESTJs feel comfortable with. A real sense of joy and satisfaction comes to the fore when everyone is contributing in a harmonious, sharing fashion.
</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs value the concrete, specific and realistic, and feel comfortable giving and receiving precise instructions. They also value organised and predictable systems, which provide a sense of stability and predictability to their environment. Likewise ESTJs are able to provide consistence in terms of their work delivery if these aspects are in place.</p>

<p class="body1">If ESTJs can see the common benefit of a task, assignment or goal, they are able to work energetically towards the completion of such a task. Do not expect them to challenge the rationale behind procedures, systems and policies; their preference and strength lies in the world of implementation. They are very good at enhancing and building on what already exists. Do not expect them to breach rules, even if the execution thereof has a plausible reason. They work best in an environment where they can achieve and accomplish what is expected in an ethical and committed manner.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs also value ownership. They seek to possess and preserve objects which are of importance to them. Providing them with rewards that are tangible and which represent their hard work, commitment and success can be very motivating. ESTJs tend to see the world in black or white. They consequently have little tolerance for ambiguity, and tend to become angry and bogged down by ambiguous situations. It is therefore important to provide them with clear guidelines and expectations in a constant manner.</p>

<p class="body1">In a sense, ESTJs seem to know that their role in life is to make the most of what is there. Their energies are not directed toward questioning, challenging and tampering with existing realities; rather, the challenge is one of fitting into and enhancing what is there. They prefer to make the very best of a given situation without attempting to start a minor revolution when there is a breakdown.</p>


<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>


<p class="body1">ESTJs are visual and concrete learners who retain learning through concrete methods where they can use workbooks requiring memorisation, recall and drill. Being linear in their thinking processes, a learning environment primed to the acquisition of new knowledge and skills through practical means works best. ESTJs do not particularly enjoy the theoretical, but the provision of comparisons and specific examples assist in retaining theoretical knowledge. Introducing information in sequential steps provides the best chance for successful integration.</p>

<h1>Management Style</h1>

<p class="body1">ESTJs manage in a results orientated, authoritarian, decisive and co operative fashion. An expectation exists from ESTJ managers that employees and co workers will follow the rules and standard operating procedures of the organisation without question. Just as they value ownership, they also value and respect hierarchies, positions and titles. In leadership positions, they strive to preserve tradition. To ESTJs rituals, ceremonies and celebrations are valued and provide a sense of permanence and belonging.</p>


<p class="body1">ESTJ workers and managers alike like to follow through where very little, if anything, is left to chance. A tendency exists to be sticklers for detail. ESTJs are masterful at carrying out tasks and following routines. They are likewise able to create guidelines and directions to others to achieve the same aim.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs are likely to be accountable and responsible, which makes them good managers. They are known to be diligent, focused, energetic workers, and expect the same of, their subordinates. They therefore believe that appreciation must be earned and as a result, it is sometimes difficult for them to provide positive feedback to others simply because they set such high standards. Compromise on these standards is unacceptable and the feedback most often offered by the ESTJ is directed at an individual to get them back on course and to correct mistakes.</p>


<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>

<p class="body1">Placing faith in the tried and tested, ESTJs should be cautioned to watch out for the tendency to be become too rigid. Trusting in their own beliefs, it is also important that they remember to value the input and opinions other people can bring. ESTJs tend to reprimand and not provide positive feedback when necessary. It is useful for them to understand that others might value positive feedback. The absence of feedback can be perceived by others as criticism, which frequently results in a decline in productivity and reduces motivation to deliver superior performance.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJs tend to neglect their Feeling side, and in the process may have a problem with fulfilling others' needs for intimacy. At times they might unknowingly hurt other people's feelings by applying logic and reason. Some situations demand more emotional sensitivity, and the ESTJ could benefit by asking for assistance from more Feeling orientated individuals. Coaching could also assist in this regard. It is useful to make ESTJs aware that their focus on the task to be accomplished can subordinate the human element, sometimes to the detriment of task completion.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJ's strong sense of responsibility sometimes leads to them taking on too much work and becoming overloaded to the point of exhaustion. ESTJs experience stress due to their never ending desire to address all their (often self assigned) burdens and tasks, and to live up to the high standards they set for themselves. A feeling of isolation is often experienced under such circumstances, which could lead to feelings of being misunderstood and undervalued. They might also feel that their efforts are not recognised or appreciated. Although ESTJs are normally known for their precise communication style, their discomfort with emotions tends to inhibit the ability to translate feelings into words. When ESTJs withdraw from others it is normally an indication that they are encountering difficulty with the emotional impact of stressful events. Becoming aware of this kind of behaviour can assist ESTJs and those around them to assist.</p>

<p class="body1">Due to the high standards and expectations that ESTJs set for themselves and others, they are likely to be disappointed when others do not follow through. To them this indicates a non caring attitude, which normally elicits harsh and demanding behaviour towards the perceived perpetrators. Becoming aware of other Type preferences and what motivates them could assist in identifying the source of the under performance.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTJ's basic attitude is that of fatalism. They tend to believe that little can be done to change life circumstances and that one is well advised to accept one's lot in life. Thus, they are not motivated to promote change. The best way to motivate an ESTJ to support change is to demonstrate that change will work. Subsequently, ESTJs do not like to take risks which are better left to preference types more comfortable with uncertainty.</p>

<p class="body1">It could be of assistance to explain to those working with and reporting to ESTJs that the ESTJ might create the impression of being impersonal, cold, and callous or lacking in human understanding, whereas they actually care intensely about people and their well being.</p>
