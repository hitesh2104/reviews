    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">The ESFP's primary mode of living is externally focused, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Their secondary mode is internal, where they deal with things according to how they feel about them, or how they fit in with their personal value systems.</p>

<p class="body1">The ESFP's world is one of people possibilities. They value people and like new experiences. They are lively individuals who enjoy being the centre of attention and who enjoy drama and excitement in their lives. Blessed with extraordinary inter personal skills, ESFPs often find themselves in the role of the peacemaker. Decisions are driven by personal values, which enable them to be concerned and sympathetic towards other people's well being.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs are generous and warm, with the ability to sense people problems due to their keen observational skills. They tend to offer advice and practical solutions when needed, although their advice might not always be well thought through.</p></td>

<p class="body1">ESFPs are spontaneous, acting in the moment with a predisposition for having fun. They tend to look on the brighter side of life, with an ability to affect others positively. Their Thinking side might not be that well developed, which causes them to neglect their rational thinking processes and can in turn lead to a focus on immediate gratification and sensation seeking. As a result, they tend to neglect duties and obligations, which could have a negative impact in the long term.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs love to perform. They like to entertain others and to make them happy. They are good at stimulating people's senses and would like life to be one continual party. Other people also tend to be attracted to the light heartedness of ESFPs. ESFPs are generally accepting of others and it is a rare occasion for someone to fall out of their favour. When this does happen though, the ESFP is likely to make a very strong and stubborn judgment against the person they perceived to have crossed them. They are capable of deep dislike in such a situation.</p>

<p class="body1">When under stress, ESFPs may become bogged down with negative thoughts and possibilities. While they function well in a world infused with possibilities, negative possibilities create strong emotions that are difficult to deal with. Their way of handling such situations is to come up with simple, global statements designed to explain the problem away. These explanations might not truly get to the nature of the issue, but they serve the ESFP well by allowing them an opportunity to get over it.</p>

<p class="body1">Although ESFPs have a strong dislike for routine and structure, they tend to be very practical. Their preference is to 'go with the flow', trusting in their ability to improvise in the moment when a situation presents itself. Learning is enhanced through 'hands on' experiences, rather than through studying a book. As such, they do not like theoretical learning. ESFPs deal better with situations involving theoretical thinking as well as the complex and ambiguous if they've developed their Intuitive side. Interacting and debating with others assists in retaining knowledge.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs are sometimes known as the 'performer', an individual with a natural and deep appreciation for beauty and the finer things in life. In some instances they tend to choose careers which will afford an expression of their excellent sense of function and space.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs function well as team players and have a tendency to create a light, fun filled environment where task completion becomes easy. ESFPs will do best in careers in which they are able to use their excellent people skills, in combination with their abilities to fuse ideas into structured formats. Preferring a fast pace and exposure to new experiences, they will do well to choose careers which offer or require a lot of diversity and people interaction.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ESFPs excel at tactical tasks, with an ability to overcome any obstacle with accuracy and skill. ESFPs are very project oriented and enjoy a challenge where there will be tangible results. They never seem to run out of resources and will do whatever they can to get the job done. ESFPs work well in an environment where they have ample opportunity for stimulation and new experiences. They bring a lively, festive atmosphere to the workplace and do not do well with too many directives and rules.</p>

<p class="body1">Being good at observing human behaviour, they tend to work best where performance is an external process. Their observation of others is often put to good use; ESFPs adapt their own behaviour to suit that of others. They are very good at evoking responses from others and they are able to get people to work together.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs have an uncanny ability to bring out the lighter side of life. They are mostly known as entertainers, and are sometimes the clowns of the workplace. Problems and challenges represent a life force of its own to the ESFP; without it they tend to expand their energy in non productive ways.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs communicate in a concrete and specific way. Language is one of many tools in their repertoire of equipment to get things done. Although their language is likely to be full of realistic and concrete images, the most gifted among them can use abstract language to meet their ends.</p>

<p class="body1">Good at engaging and entertaining others, ESFPs tend to be very talkative with the unique gift to keep others stimulated. They are in touch with the finer thins in life and do well in the fashion, food and creative industries. ESFPs tend to be highly gifted in some artistic direction. In other words, they tare likely to excel in specific areas of interest, be they the performing arts, whipping up fabulous and creative meals, scuba diving, hang gliding, dancing, sculpting, sports, and on and on and on.</p>

<p class="body1">Anything that captures the ESFP's interest, or is a special strength or capability, needs to be attempted and perfected. Therefore, encourage and support ESFPs in an artistic direction; after all, they are performing for you, and if there is no audience and shared excitement, what is the point?</p>

<p class="body1">It is important to keep ESFPs mobile, as they do very well in positions that present problems to be solved and crises to handle. They are not only good at making a positive contribution in reducing the effects of crises on others, but are equally effective in resolving their personal crises.</p>
<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>

<p class="body1">The freedom to act is very important to the ESFP. As such they typically tend to avoid ties, routines, systems, plans, commitments and any obligations that could conceivably get in the way of their freedom to choose their next action steps. Therefore it is important to provide opportunities for action, variety and, if possible, excitement.</p>
<p>Do not expect ESFPs to follow the 'rule book'. They might rebel if too many constraints are placed on their freedom. They do excel at taking risks and such opportunities will bring out the best in them. ESFPs in leadership positions do well with the support of well organised support staff to provide reminders of commitments and to implement follow through.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs value personal skills, co ordination and behavioural effectiveness. They feel embarrassed by clumsy performance in themselves or others, and any opportunity for development will most likely be taken on with enthusiasm. Thus, provide plenty of opportunity for ESFPs to exercise their skills of showmanship, their ability to influence others, as well as an outstanding ability to promote in all manner of environments. They will most likely not let the organisation down as their performance in whatever form must be mastered superbly to achieve perfection.</p>


<p class="body1">ESFPs should preferably be shielded from theoretical abstractions and philosophical reasoning; their strength lies in action and being able to influence others to action.</p>
<p class="body1">ESPFs function best in the 'here and the now' and their energies are best applied in the moment. They tend to be optimistic, always expecting things to turn out well. As a result, there are times when they tend to take risks and are indeed motivated by such events. Therefore they may be willing to take chances where others would not. This character trait should be provided for, but also monitored carefully.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs work well in environments where pleasure is valued, and where employees are allowed and encouraged to enjoy life to the full. Negative environments are not good for them and they would do well to stay clear of toxic spaces. ESFPs don't do well with ambiguous situations either and prefer taking action even if they are unsure about the outcome.</p>
<p class="body1">The ideal ESFP work environment is one which offers opportunities, choices, flexibility and people interaction. They do not enjoy being alone and find physically attractive workspaces inspiring; they need a space where they can enjoy the freedom to express themselves.</p>

<p class="body1">Once interested and engaged, ESFPs are naturally absorbed in the activity they are busy with. Others rarely experience this kind of absorption.</p>
<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">ESFPs learn best through active personal involvement and the use of hands on methods such as projects. They retain learning better if they are shown how to do something rather than hearing about it. They are normally good at solving concrete problems, and have a great deal of confidence in themselves to solve these problems without the aid of a manual or directions. As such, they have a talent for accurate, action oriented observation type of learning. The more concrete and specific, the better; abstract presentations are likely to bore them.</p>

<p class="body1">Being people directed, ESFPs enjoy group interaction and learn well through this kind of process. Learning is mostly not undertaken for learning's sake, but for the results it can produce, the tools it provides, and the fun experienced in the process. Any kind of learning intervention which is perceived to be boring by the ESFP will quickly be enthused with excitement and action.</p>

<h1>Management Style</h1>
<p class="body1">The management style of the ESFP is relaxed and easy going, yet pragmatic and convenient. ESFP managers do whatever needs to be done to get the job done with the least possible effort. ESFPs function well in environments having to deal with crises.</p>

<p class="body1">As managers, they do well in situations calling for immediate action and will go out of their way to find solutions to their subordinates' exciting problems.</p>

<p class="body1">Being action oriented, ESFP managers focus on mobilising people to get the job done and solving concrete problems. Don't be surprised if the ESFP manager finds ways to bypass the necessary 'red tape' if it gets in the way. They are also able to come up with creative ways to expedite tasks in the least complicated manner. As leaders they often find themselves in a position of being trouble shooters since they are naturally inclined to work at finding solutions to problems. They have the added advantage of spotting trouble early due to their ability to live in the present.</p>

<p class="body1">In addition to being good problem solvers, ESFPs can be counted on to get people working together to the greater good of the organisation. They are also gifted at taking the lead in starting new projects. People tend to co operate with them readily and find the ESFP manager easy to get along with. ESFP managers are good at giving verbal praise and will do so without hesitation.</p>

<p class="body1">ESFPs react well to change, and will most likely be the ones to institute it. They are open to trying out new ways of doing things and will most likely come up with solutions more often than other types. They typically ask: 'will it work', 'are there other viewpoints to be considered?'; 'is it practical?' However, they tend to dislike the unfamiliar and may be uncomfortable with changes that they themselves have not initiated.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>
<p class="body1">Enjoying interpersonal action as much as they do, ESFPs sometimes neglect the task at hand. Being gifted at 'winging it', they sometimes arrive unprepared, which can be offensive to other types. They could be reminded of the importance of preparation, especially if it is expected of the whole group. Their focus on being improvisation oriented could cause them to miss the counter productive implications of their actions.</p>

<p class="body1">With their focus on a 'quick fix', ESFPs tend to be impatient with longer range solutions. Being so good at creating solutions to current crisis situations, they sometimes overlook the usefulness of looking at abstract data.</p>

<p class="body1">Structured environments might cause a great deal of frustration to ESFPs. Their insatiable hunger for spontaneity could be considered as rather irresponsible by other types who work well in a structured work environment. Becoming aware of the impact of such behaviour on others could challenge the ESFPs to develop an understanding for the need of structure in others, especially those reporting in to their position. It could also assist in seeing the value of and positive benefits of planned activities and task completion. Likewise ESFPs might need to be reminded of the necessity to meet deadlines and finish projects, although implementation is best left to other types.</p>
