    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">The ISTJ's primary mode of living is internally focused, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Their secondary mode is external, where they deal with things rationally and logically.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTJs value security and a peaceful environment, and often create the impression of being reserved and quiet. They experience a strongly-felt sense of duty and ISTJs will almost always follow through on the tasks to which they are committed. Others describe them as serious and private. They are organised and methodical in their approach and generally succeed at any task they assume.</p>
<p class="body1">Honesty and integrity are important attributes to the ISTJ and they tend to be faithful, loyal and dependable. They have a strong sense of 'doing what is right', to the benefit of their communities, workspace and family members. The ISTJ, although serious by nature, can also be fun, especially in work and family-related gatherings. They have an offbeat sense of humour which they show to those they feel comfortable with and trust.</p></td>

<p class="body1">ISTJs will normally abide to the laws and traditions of a society or organisation, and they expect the same of others. Breaking the rules goes against their sense of duty and can create a great deal of distress. However, if a good reason exists for bending the rules, the ISTJ will support that effort. The way they do things is normally directed and executed according to a set of procedures or a plan. The ISTJ who has not developed their intuitive side might feel obliged to lead their lives 'according to the book'.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs are dependable and normally follow through on their allotted tasks and promises. As a result, they are sometimes the receivers of more and more work, especially since those allocating the work know that the ISTJ will deliver. They generally find it difficult to say 'no' to more work than they can reasonably handle and often work long hours, sometimes being taken advantage of.</p>

<p class="body1">It is important that the ISTJ understands and can make sense of the duties and tasks assigned to them. Although they will work diligently for long hours and expend great amounts of energy to fulfil tasks and goals, they will tend to resist if they cannot identify the practical application of work. They generally work best alone, but will not be averse to working in teams if the situation demands it. They excel at positions of authority, especially since they like to be accountable for their actions. ISTJs are not naturally attracted to the world of the abstract or theory, unless they can see the practical application thereof.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs use their Sensing preference to gather and store facts, which they regard with respect. They might struggle to understand an idea or theory which differs from their perspective. If the theory or idea is explained by someone they hold in high regard, a tendency exists for the idea to become fact, which the ISTJ will most likely support. And once an ISTJ supports an idea or cause, they will most likely stop at nothing to give their support and, in so doing, live up to their duty.</p>
<p class="body1">Because ISTJs live internally, they are naturally in tune with their own emotions, and tend to understand those of others, although it might not be identified as quickly as other types can. ISTJs tend to be perfectionistic and expect the same of others. They are inclined to take their own and others' efforts for granted and need to be reminded to reward themselves and others for their efforts.</p>

<p class="body1">The expression of feeling might be the cause of discomfort, but if they sense that a situation requires it, they are usually quite supportive and caring towards the individuals they care about. Once they realise the emotional needs of those close to them, they are able to put in great effort to meet those needs.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTJs take their responsibility to family and work seriously. It is important to understand that they are traditional and family-orientated, and that this focus takes great amounts of energy to make their family, home and work life run smoothly. They care deeply for those close to them, although their preference is to express care as opposed to expressing their feelings. As a result they are loyal and faithful workers and society members.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs are gifted in the planning, organising and implementation of a task, seeing it through to its completion. Their sense of function and space is normally well developed and they might show an artistic appreciation in the careers they pursue. Their office space will normally be immaculately maintained and tastefully furnished. They feel comfortable in a space that is attuned to their senses, allowing structure, beauty and order.</p>

<p class="body1">Under stress, they ISTJ might feel that their normal sense of calm has abandoned them. They tend to move into 'catastrophe mode', not being able to see a positive outcome and only focusing on that which can go wrong.</p>

<p class="body1">Under these circumstances they tend to berate themselves for what they perceive to be their own failure, thinking of what they could have done differently, or which duties they could have performed better. Where they are normally calm and reasonable, they tend to move to a space of chaos and doom, finding it difficult to regain their usual balance.</p>
<p class="body1">The ISTJ excels in a logical, reasonable and fair environment. They are one of the few Types who are highly effective at achieving their chosen goals, whatever they decide to focus on and pour energy into.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<p class="body1">ISTJs are good at preserving life, which means that they tend to focus on the preservation of resources within an organisation. They will also ensure that their efforts are directed to the satisfaction of economic needs in such an environment. They are thus able to focus on utility, production and being careful of how their decisions impact on these factors.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJ's general attitude is that of concern, and although quiet, serious and reserved, they are very good at seeing a job through to its completion. They will respect rules and procedures, and are able to easily identify those who do not comply. They are especially skilled at logistical and material tasks, and are able to get the right things in the right place at the right time in the right quantity and the right quality. ISTJs don't take anything for granted and will generally not read more into a situation than is present. As such they excel at the inspection of contracts and documents that might impact on the wellbeing of the organisation. ISTJs are so natural at inspection that they are able to compare performance or a product to a standard with a thoroughness rarely encountered in other types. They excel at quality control tasks, with an attention to detail and gathering facts.</p>
<p class="body1">Their natural inclination to focus on detail allows them to handle complex figures and to easily make sense of that which can be overwhelming to others. This ability enables them to measure variances quickly and easily. ISTJs have an almost built in ability to register whether something is out of place.</p>
<p class="body1">ISTJs are able to express themselves in a concrete and specific manner, and will give sufficient information especially to describe the steps involved to get things done. They work well in situations that require them to think in a linear fashion rather than several things being processed at once in no particular sequence. Once an ISTJ has reached a decision it can be trusted to be well thought through and aimed at bringing stability to the organisation. Do not expect ISTJs to be revolutionary; they are best applied to reinforce and strengthen that which is already in place. They are good at co-operating with others and are driven to establish and maintain the necessary regulatory processes to allow everyone to work toward the goals of the organisation.</p>
<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">Security and a sense of 'belonging' are important to ISTJs. It is therefore important to provide them with an opportunity to be active participants in organisations. Providing a clear expectation of their responsibilities and duties enables the ISTJ to know what is expected of them so that they can work towards these goals. These guidelines should be
devoid of ambiguity and agreed upon in order to assist the hard-working and dedicated ISTJ to create boundaries so that they do not commit to unrealistic expectations set by others.</p>
<p class="body1">The ISTJ's quantitative skill and ability for standardisation should be used in the organisation as it is a rare skill seldom found in other types. ISTJs do well in spaces where they are provided with responsibility which is clearly stated and action orientated. It would be best to choose the ISTJs co-workers with care as they battle to work with those they view as 'irresponsible'. They also expect the person in charge to be obeyed and not questioned. It could assist the ISTJ to encourage them to ask questions and be frank in their assessment of authority figures. Normally authority is granted by tenure and title.</p>

<p class="body1">Tasks such a cold calling should be minimised, as would any kind of unstructured contact with people. Although ISTJs tend to be reserved and quiet, they work well in an environment where structure and direction are provided. It could also be beneficial to provide the ISTJ with clear expectations regarding their duties, as merely giving information will tend to frustrate them. They may also be impatient in dealing with others' problems, unless they have received the mandate to resolve the problems of those reporting in to their position. In essence, the ISTJ would rather avoid conflict situations, especially if they perceive the conflict to be caused by those who are irresponsible, disloyal or impractical.</p>
<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>
<p class="body1">ISTJ do well with modes of instruction that requires them to learn though concrete methods. As such they are good at learning with the aid of workbooks and can easily memorise and recall that which they learn through rote. They react well to abstract modes of learning and tend to find the abstract world unreliable and untrustworthy.
ISTJs tend to learn faster if they are provided with comparisons and concrete examples. Their natural preference is biased to measurement and viewing the world from a quantity perspective. Being concrete and specific, they have difficulty in recognising abstract dimensions.</p>

<h1>Management Style</h1>
<p class="body1">The management style of the ISTJ will most likely be best described as being decisive and authoritarian. The ISTJ manager expects their subordinates to follow the rules and procedures without question. Placing faith in title and tenure provides for hierarchical respect. The ISTJ manager will most likely provide a work environment which is stable and orderly, and where tasks are defined. They will provide information that provides guidance in terms of expectations, tasks and completion dates.</p>

<p class="body1">Thus their management style will be predictable and formal, focusing on what is in the greatest interest of the organisation. ISTJ managers focus so much on task completion that they can become 'threatening' to others. Because their aim is to focus on meeting objectives in a 'no-nonsense' fashion, others can also perceive them as controlling and uncaring, which is unintentional. Due to these factors, they might find it difficult to express their appreciation of others.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJ managers excel at running meetings, able to provide an agenda and with a preference for tasks to be completed on time and according to schedule. When meetings become bogged down with too much process, ISTJ managers can become frustrated and annoyed, preferring to move on to action and task completion.
<h1>Potential Areas for Development </h1>

<p class="body1">Task completion is very important to the ISTJ, to such an extent that they could ignore the human element. It could assist them to see the perspective of others as 'facts' to be considered in the decision making process. Rules and regulations are likewise important to ISTJ. This can also be the cause of overlooking the needs of those with whom they work. It could be beneficial for them to take the time to listen to others without judgement.</p>

<p class="body1">Procedures can sometimes become overly important, and it will be good to consider their value beyond utility. Because of their insistence on rules, procedures and regulations, ISTJs could resist opportunities for change. Being so hard-working and dedicated, ISTJs might not always understand that other types work best in bursts of energy and that they are more productive in this manner. The tendency to take on responsibility, in combination with their commitment to completing tasks, might create opportunities where the ISTJ could find it difficult to say 'no'. As a result they can become overworked and overburdened. Being perfectionistic in nature also makes it difficult to relinquish responsibility and to delegate tasks, unless they have a great deal of confidence that their subordinates will follow through. It may be useful to remind the ISTJ that delegation allows more time for their own responsibilities and task completion.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs tend to see the world in black and white, with a strong belief in what is wrong and what is right. If others do not live up to this understanding, they tend to become negative and reproachful. ISTJs also tend to reprimand on the spot, especially if they think that others have 'stepped out of line'. The ISTJ's tendency to reflect and be careful with regard to decision making assists in preventing problems before they occur. It can also cause frustration to others and create the impression that they are indecisive.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs are well advised to seek out information about the broader perspectives and subtle implications of a proposed decision or action, as their focus tends to be on concrete detail, data and facts. They are also inclined to overlook the more subtle factors influencing group behaviour, and could enlist the assistance of an NF to incorporate the implications of people values prior to decision making.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJ's focus on facts, data and detail creates an objective stance, which can sometimes be experienced as cold and uncaring. This is often not the case as ISTJs are caring individuals and vulnerable to criticism. As such they are not known for their effusive interpersonal warmth and would benefit from practise in active listening to acquire a vocabulary which suits other personality types.</p>

<p class="body1">ISTJs tend to form a first impression of anyone they meet or work with relatively quickly, which tends to remain for a fairly long time. Commitment to a self-constructed and imposed impression may be ineffective - and to admit that can be quite painful for less enlightened ISTJs.</p>
