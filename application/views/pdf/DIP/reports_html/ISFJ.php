    <td width="320" ><p class="body1">ISFJ's primary mode of living is internally focused, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Their secondary mode is external, where they deal with things according to how they feel about them, or how they fit into their personal value systems.
</p>
<p class="body1">ISFJs live in a world that is both kind-hearted and concrete. They like to believe that other people are good and focus on the best in others. Harmony and co-operation is important to them, and they are likely to be sensitive to the feelings of those around them. Other people appreciate the ISFJ for their sensitivity and consideration.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs use their senses to gather information about the situations and people that are important to them, and tend to deal with this in a private, inner world not easily accessible to others. Being driven by their values system and with a focus on that which is important to them, they have an amazing ability to memorise events and people. If an event makes an impression on an ISFJ, they are likely to recall the precise details years later, especially facial expressions.</p></td>

<p class="body1">ISFJs value security and kindness, and generally respect the laws and traditions of organisations. Existing systems are obeyed and followed, simply because the ISFJ believes that in order for it to exist, it should work. The ISFJ has a clear expectation of how they think things should be, therefore they are not likely to want to change the natural order of things.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs are not likely to be found in the fields of theory or conceptual analysis. They learn best through practical application, and will most likely avoid reading about or applying theory. Practical application is valued above all, and they tend to shy away from traditional spaces of learning, like those found in higher education which might require abstract thought and theoretical learning. The ISFJ can nevertheless be counted on to use the practical skills they acquire, especially to complete that which they start. They are known for their dependability.</p>

<p class="body1">The ISFJ's sense of function, space and aesthetic appeal is extremely well developed. They are likely to live in functional homes that are beautiful and tastefully furnished. They are known to make extremely good interior decorators. Their appreciation of the finer things in life, combined with their love for people, make them thoughtful and sensitive to the feelings and desires of others. If a gift is given by an ISFJ, it will most likely be well thought through and appeal to the receiver.</p>

<p class="body1">The ISFJ is very much aware of their own feelings; possibly even more so than other types. They are likewise able to focus on and observe the feelings of others. They don't usually share their feelings, and negative emotions can turn into firm judgements against others, which are difficult to change. ISFJs are more likely to speak up for others than themselves, and are able to assist others when they feel that their rights are being threatened. ISFJs are able to assist others in becoming aware of their feelings.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs take their responsibilities seriously and can be counted on to follow through on their commitments. People naturally tend to rely on the duty-bound ISFJ, who might have difficulty in saying 'no' to the requests of other people. As a result, ISFJs can become overburdened if they don't learn to choose who they assist more wisely. ISFJs tend to put the needs of others above their own and are unlikely to speak out because they dislike conflict so much.</p>

<p class="body1">Being liked and receiving positive appreciation from others is important to the ISFJ. Without it, they are likely to become depressed and, under extreme pressure, they tend to
experience intense feelings of inadequacy, believing that they 'can't do anything right' and that 'all else is wrong'.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs are dependable, warm and supportive. They contribute by ensuring that things run smoothly and it will be to their advantage to be less critical of themselves and to give themselves some of the same appreciation and love that they so generously bestow on others.</p>
<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>

<p class="body1">ISFJs are skilled in anything having to do with logistics, especially in the service occupations, where their abilities can be directed at people. They excel at getting the right things in the right place in the right quantity, the right quality, at the right time and to the right people. As such they are good at the arrangement and execution of quantitative and standardising skills.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs might not reveal their deeply felt emotions, or express the care they hold for others in words, but prefer to show their caring in deeds. As such they are good at jobs where they can take care of people, such as those found in the service occupations. A position that requires the execution of routines is a comfortable and good fit for their skills. As a result they tend to serve with care and gentleness, and relate well to taking care of those in need.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs are concrete and specific in the manner in which they communicate, and they are likely to provide ample information, especially gifted in explaining the necessary steps involved in doing something. ISFJs also prefer to be given step-by-step instructions as opposed to general directives. Their thought process is linear and they contribute best when an expectation exists to action tasks in a particular sequence. Once committed, the ISFJ is tenacious, especially in seeing task related actions that they are expected to complete through to their conclusion. Once they've bought into an organisation and decided to lend their support, they are known to be exceptionally dedicated with no limits to the contribution they are willing to make.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>


<p class="body1">ISFJs are inclined to take responsibility for more than their fair share and to worry about the fate of people and the world. ISFJs pride themselves on being accountable and, more often than not, feel obliged to fulfil their assigned duties. At times they expect that things will not always work well and make provision for these expectations. As a result, the ISFJ has a built in tendency to become stressed. It is therefore advisable to ensure that they do not take on too much responsibility as they tend to do, since the possibility exists that their stress will manifest in a health-related affliction.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs have little tolerance for ambiguity, and they do well with receiving assurances to minimise uncertainty. One way of doing so is to provide them with step-by-step and clearly formulated expectations of their tasks. Their need for stability and security is thus the gateway to their well-being and should be taken care of. As such, it might also be a good idea to limit exposure to risk taking and best leave this to the types more comfortable with this way of being.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs give freely of themselves and might feel taken advantage of or that others are not grateful for their sacrifices. This can lead to resentment and suffering. An environment where there is freedom to act and where competition is limited, assists the ISFJ to provide their best input while also limiting the opportunity to feel too responsible and taking on too much. They work best toward the greater good of a team and derive satisfaction from knowing that things work, there are no surprises and that the work environment is predictable, safe and stable.</p>

<p class="body1">The opportunity to contribute to the wellbeing of others brings great satisfaction and such situations should be made available to the ISFJ employee. They tend to obey the person in authority without question, and believe in the power of tenure and title. Likewise they do not have patience with those types who may question those in positions of leadership. As a result ISFJ employees might ignore policies, procedures or organisational laws in favour of loyalty and devotion to those to whom they report. It could be helpful for them to be open-minded and listen to the types who tend to question authority figures within reason.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs work well with and respect other employees and superiors who have proven their expertise and competence in the past, especially those with educational or organisational achievements under the belt.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJs function well in a harmonious environment. They do not react particularly well in confrontational situations and will tend to ignore conflict in the hope that it will go away. Positions that require ISFJs to deal with confrontation on a regular basis are not in their best interest and should be avoided. They could be assisted in creating an understanding of how conflict can be used to increase interpersonal relationships in the long run.</p>

<p class="body1">Membership is important to ISFJs and they use this as a way of showing their loyalty to causes that are in line with their value systems. They work well for organisations that show an affinity for the preservation of life or support the continuation of culture. ISFJs are duty bound and they tend to identify with the causes, leaders and social purposes of an organisation, especially if these contribute to the greater social order.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>

<p class="body1">ISFJs retain information better through concrete learning methods such as those offered through workbooks. They are generally good at memorisation, recall and drill. Their preference for linear learning is optimised through the step-by-step introduction of new material. The ability to use the information they acquire is important to them, and they will naturally learn more effectively if a concrete payoff is identified.</p>

<p class="body1">Thus the utilisation of what they learn is very important to them. ISFJs have a natural inclination to assess quantities and excel at measurement-related activities; these are likely to be areas where they will learn quicker and retain knowledge better. They do not hold a natural affinity for theories and abstract learning. They react well when provided with factual information, but will learn even more effectively if personalised examples and comparisons are included in the learning material.</p>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
<p class="body1">ISFJ managers use an understanding, kind approach, where they focus on creating harmony and providing a space for mutual support. Their tendency is to achieve results through team work and to create a feeling of belonging to those reporting in to their positions. They manage in a personal way and pay attention to the needs and wants of others.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJ managers are conscientious and responsible, with a preference to create order and to be alert to those around them. They are normally predictable and tend to assume that they know what people need, based on what they think is customary. It would be advisable for the ISFJ manager to explore the opinions of people in order to ascertain whether their assumptions are correct.</p>

<p class="body1">As such other types can be consulted, whose needs might differ from those of the ISFJ and, in doing so, the ISFJ manager is able to enhance the overall effectiveness of the organisation.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJ mangers are good at creating stability, and they do so by paying attention to the needs and opinions of others to ascertain the acceptable social standards, as well as adhering to a work ethic that they deem appropriate. If an opportunity for change presents itself, they will typically enquire about its usefulness, practicality, past performance success and whether it is socially acceptable. Change that is not anticipated can cause some resistance from ISFJ managers if they perceive that the proposed change will cause disruption. They do not take kindly to uncertainty and unpredictability, and can become somewhat stubborn if the order and stability of their world is disrupted.</p>

<p class="body1">The ISFJ manager's first instinct it to preserve tradition and they instinctively know that rituals, values, ceremonies and celebrations create a sense of belonging and permanence in an organisation. If these don't exist in a workspace, they are likely to create them. Tradition will though centre on people and it will be executed in an unassuming and kind manner. They are typically very good at remembering birthdays and employees' personal celebration days.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJ managers are especially good at providing support, assisting subordinates and enabling people to perform. They are not typically the ones to come up with revolutionary concepts or outstanding new ideas. ISFJ managers are typically loyal to and responsive towards the people they work with. They do not take kindly to those who do not follow through on their promises and work commitments, and their irritation tends to be internalised. ISFJ managers do not express their disapproval verbally and it can transform into interpersonal tension and stressful situations.</p>

<p class="body1">ISFJ managers are action orientated and they like to get things done and work well in an environment where they can prioritise work for subordinates. Although they have the ability to interact well with others, they tend to favour deadlines and getting the job done above all else. Their aim is to obtain results, which could have a negative influence on their sensitivity toward others. They excel in providing the necessary skills and resources to enable staff to function well.</p>

<p class="body1">The ISFJ manager's focus is on work completion, and they tend to reward those employees who complete work above those who might take longer to complete tasks. Their feedback is likely to focus on correcting mistakes or deviations, and they can sometimes be perceived as being blunt or critical which could lead to further falls in productivity. It may be appropriate for ISFJ managers to become more aware of and give attention and praise to those who are less than star performers.</p>
