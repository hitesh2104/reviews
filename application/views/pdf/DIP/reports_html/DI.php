<h1>Your Report</h1>


<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">A profile of this type represents a highly assertive person,
capable of both direct, dynamic action or charming sociability
as a situation demands. In combination, these factors describe
a person with clear goals in life with the determination and
commitment to achieve them. This style of person will seek to
maintain a position of dominance, both in terms of personal
authority and control, but also in a social sense - they like to
feel that they are not only respected by those working with
them, but also genuinely liked. This powerful behavioural style
is often called the 'Lazy Z' in reference to its characteristic DISC
profile shape.

 </p><h1>Relating to Others</h1>
<p>
This type is characterised by strong social skills and a persuasive communication style. They are capable of great charm, but will sometimes adopt a more demanding, overbearing approach, especially if they feel themselves to be under pressure. The outgoing and quickly-paced approach of this kind of person can be difficult to deal with for less assertive or direct types, especially as they have no fear of confrontation and will address issues directly rather than prevaricate or evade.</p>

    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">Challenge is a keyword for this type - they thrive in situations that others would find impossibly stressful and difficult to deal with. Their need for achievement means that they are willing to undertake almost any task to achieve success or recognition, and this driving, motivated approach lends them an urgency and energy rarely seen in other behavioural types. </p>
<p class="body1">Regular DISC users will recognize this profile shape as the classic ideal for direct sales work. This type of occupation typifies the characteristics of the Lazy Z, the ability to think and react quickly, adapt to challenging situations and use powers of both assertiveness and persuasion to motivate others to accept their own proposals.</p>

<h1>Motivating Factors</h1>

    <td width="390" ><p class="body1">As we have already seen, success and recognition are the twin motivating factors for a person with high Dominance and Influence. To be content, they must feel that they are a success in both their business and personal lives. More than this, they are motivated by challenge - stagnation is anathema to a person of this type, and they need to set themselves lofty goals and ambitions, and aim steadily towards these, if they are to operate at their best.</p>
