<div class="tips">

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p class="body1">ESTP's primary mode of living is focused externally, where they take things in via the five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Their secondary mode is internal, where they deal with things rationally and logically.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs are outgoing and straight forward types. They tend to be enthusiastic and excitable, and are typically described as 'doers' who prefer to live in a world filled with action. They sometimes create the impression of being blunt, simply because they are always willing to plunge right into things and get their hands dirty. ESTPs live in the here and now, and pay little attention to introspection or theory. They like to look at the facts of a situation, quickly decide what should be done, execute the action, and move on to the next situation.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs have an uncanny ability to perceive people's attitudes and motivations. They have the ability to pick up on little clues which might go unnoticed by most other types. They are particularly good at reading facial expressions and interpreting body language. ESTPs use this ability to read others and to get what they want out of a situation.</p></td>

<p class="body1">Rules and laws are not that important and are typically used as guidelines for behaviour, rather than directives. The action of 'doing' is the primary focus. However, the ESTP has strong beliefs in 'right and wrong', and will use these principles to guide their behaviour. Thus organisational rules can be broken to accomplish tasks, as long as it does not go against the ESTP's own value system.</p>
<p class="body1">ESTPs create the impression of fast talking, fast moving individuals with a strong flair for drama. They are gifted at story telling and improvising, and enjoy being in the limelight. In an organisational setting, they will make things up as they go along, rather than following a predetermined plan.</p>
<p class="body1">Like the ESFP, they love to have fun, and are likewise experienced by others as fun to be around. With a Thinking preference, they generally do not know and may not care about the effect their words have on others, sometimes unintentionally causing deep wounds. Their decision making process takes predominance to people's feelings, favouring facts and logic.</p>
<p class="body1">The fact that they are focused on the practical side of life, with an urgency to 'get things done', predisposes ESTPs against the theoretical and the intuitive. They might occasionally have strong intuitions which are likely to be off base, unless the ESTP has focused particularly on the development of the least developed preference of intuition. As a result, ESTPs do not trust their instincts, and are most likely suspicious of other people's intuitive insights as well.
ESTPs prefer exposure to tools and learning material that can assist them in 'getting things done'. As a result they get bored with learning that focuses on the theoretical and abstract.</p>
<p class="body1">Freedom of movement is highly valued by ESTPs and they do well in environments which do not restrict or confine them. Any kind of routine chore will greatly frustrate the fun and freedom loving ESTP. Although they make excellent salespeople, the type of selling they are expected to do, as well as the environment in which they need to do so, is very important. They tend to be natural entrepreneurs with an ability to 'sell' their ideas to anyone wiling to listen. ESTPs have a natural ability to motivate others and to create excitement around action. They have extraordinary talents to get things started, but might not be so good at follow through.</p>

<p class="body1">All in all, ESTPs are observant, practical, fun loving and spontaneous risk takers with an excellent ability to quickly improvise innovative solutions to problems. They're fun to be with, enthusiastic and able to motivate others. If ESTPs realise the extent of their real talents, operate within those realms and learn the art of follow through, they can accomplish truly extraordinary things.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_CTW.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">ESTPs are skilled at anything tactical, with an ability to overcome obstacles and quickly find solutions. Being resourceful, they either find what is needed or use whatever is at hand to get the job done. This also applies in terms of interpersonal interactions as they are very good at 'wheeling and dealing' types of action. ESTPs are keen and skilled observers of human behaviour, with the ability to notice and pick up on minute variations and non verbal clues. They mostly use these skills wisely in promoting and negotiating tasks.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs communicate through the use of realistic and concrete images, with the most skilled able to use abstract language to achieve their aim. Language is but a tool in their repertoire to instigate action. ESTPs have the rare ability to mirror the language of those with whom they are interacting, which makes them excellent negotiators.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs function well in environments where nothing is constant and there are no standards cast in stone. They also have the ability to charm the socks off people, with only the ESFP able to compete. The ESTP has a unique understanding of power, knowing instinctively that gaining an advantage comes from influencing and charming the power base. They can be very good at creating the situations that they want for themselves, not always interested in the needs of others.</p>

<p class="body1">Otherwise, ESTPs are at their best when responding to crisis situations and when they know that there is an opportunity to impact others via their own, hopefully, brilliant performance. As leaders, they excel at trouble shooting, always willing and able to solve problems. Due to their keen sense of reality, they are able to spot trouble early. An ability to focus on the present situation often leads to effective and beneficial results.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs are particularly good at getting things going, although it might be a bit fast for some preference types. Thus they are very good at initiating and starting projects. Always looking for action, ESTPs prefer and like to be useful, which tends to make them hard workers (as long as the work is exiting and new). They are able to create involvement and excitement where ever they go. ESTPs also direct an abundance of energy toward a specific project or assignment, especially if it prescribes to the significant and exciting.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TOF.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">An environment filled with action, challenges and opportunities, creates the best platform for the ESTP to demonstrate their skills in dealing with the unexpected. Therefore they do well in crisis situations and, being naturally primed to take action, they should be encouraged to do so. In order to ensure the best use of their time and energy, allow them to take advantage of adverse circumstances and to create success where others have failed. Indeed, any opportunity to make immediate arrangements to gain immediate effect is normally to be benefit of all.</p>

<p class="body1">Being primed to take action, ESTPs will prefer to do it their way, most likely rebelling against too many constraints on their freedom. It is best to 'guide' ESTPs, rather than to 'tell' them what to do. As such their energy is channelled in a positive manner and in a way which will benefit all.</p>

<p class="body1">It is beneficial to create opportunities to foster, improve and hone ESTP skills as behavioural effectiveness is important. They should be allowed to exercise their skills of gamesmanship, promotion and negotiation as often as possible, as they really excel at and enjoy these tasks. Having an impact on those around them, and being able to see the effect is also motivational. They enjoy a challenge and such events activate high amounts of energy at which they excel naturally, always believing that they can actually accomplish the impossible.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs enjoy any opportunity to have fun and to 'play'. They do well in environments where they are encouraged to influence others through their jovial and positive attitude. Although they enjoy competition, they will most likely create scenarios where a win win outcome is experienced by all participants. In actual fact, they feel that they have won when all participants feel that they gain from the experience.</p>

<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TRL.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">Practical, hands on learning enables ESTPs to retain new knowledge. They do well by being shown how to do things, and react well to project based learning opportunities. They find it difficult to focus on verbal instructions, most probably because it does not provide an opportunity to visualise instructions and to understand the practical implications of such instructions. Neither do they like to read through a manual or handbook. Their preference is to learn through exposure to real life and concrete problems.</p>


<p class="body1">ESTPs are very good at observation and like to use the skills they already have in training. The quicker they can see tangible and immediate results, the more enthusiastic they will be to learn. It will be wise to minimise abstract, theoretical learning as ESTPs tend to get bored and lose interest in anything they are not able to use in the 'here and now'. Thus, learning is not undertaken for learning's sake, but for the results it can produce, the tools it provides them with, or how much they enjoy the process.</p>

<br pagebreak="true"/>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_MS.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">The management style of the ESTP is pragmatic and expedient, always focusing on getting the job done. They like to see results and will do whatever is in their power to do as much, as quickly, with as little as possible. Thus they manage in a highly action oriented manner, comfortable with giving orders and not always taking the effect of their actions into account when dealing with people.
</p>
<p class="body1">Ironically, ESTPs themselves ignore authority; hence other types can be annoyed with their focus on expediting the task irrespective of violations of rules and regulations. ESTPs are known to ask peers or superiors the question, 'What policy are you talking about?' As a result they are good at 'jury rigging', without the discomfort experienced by other types. Action is almost always favoured, and a tendency exists to ignore policies, belief systems and tradition.</p>

<p class="body1">Regardless of a tendency to ignore rules, ESTPs get along so well with others that they normally do not have a problem obtaining their co operation. They are also very good at providing praise, especially if it will help to get the job done. Those who work well in an unstructured environment get along with the ESTP manager, provided not many rules are broken.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTP managers can sometimes be perceived as flighty, changing their position quickly as new facts are presented. They are likely to endorse change as long as they can see practical and quick results. They also have a tendency to jump in and assist if the change does not produce the intended result. Change implemented by themselves is normally best supported and they might kick in their heels if proposed changes bring about unfamiliarity and uncertain outcomes. ESTP managers will though prefer variations on that which they know works.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_PAD.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">Being task focused and preferring to act immediately, ESTPs might overlook the human element and the interpersonal effect their actions might have on others. Including the perspective of others as a 'factor' to be considered before they act, and making provision for the feelings of others and the impact it might have on successful improvisation, are recommended.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs might not realise it themselves, but they may be perceived by others as demanding and inconsiderate. It could help to remind ESTPs to take time to listen to others. It might be difficult and frustrating to listen for intent rather than the concrete, but it is sometimes necessary to do so in order to obtain the support of other types.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs might have to be reminded of the necessity to meet deadlines and finish projects. Where implementation is best left to other types, ESTPs would do well to develop the discipline to complete projects, especially if they want to win the respect and support to be trusted with future projects.</p>

<p class="body1">They are so ready to change course that they may not provide the stabilising force an organisation needs at certain times, and they might even be perceived as being too irresponsible for the job.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs tend to be uncomfortable with negative interpersonal interaction and might have a tendency to ignore the problem until it 'goes away'. The ESTP's focus on concrete data and details may make them blind to the more subtle factors in group behaviour and meaningful interpersonal relationships. They may be well advised to seek out information about the broader perspectives and subtle implications of a proposed action or decision, i.e. consult an NF on the value implications or an NT on the long range consequences.</p>

<p class="body1">ESTPs don't do well in an environment requiring introspection. They may even be perceived as threatening to those who experience their realities in an inner world. Those ESTPs who battle to develop their introspective side, will do best to avoid such working environments if they cannot find an NF or NT to support them.</p>

<p class="body1">They focus so much on facts, data and details, and take such an objective stance, that at times they may be experienced as cold and even inappropriately impersonal. ESTPs may thus be misperceived as being uncaring when, in fact, they do care. Likewise, others may view their objectivity as criticism and dislike. By developing their ability to listen and pay attention to others, they will be able to direct praise where it matters and has the most impact.</p>
