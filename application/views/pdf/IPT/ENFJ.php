<div class="tips">

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p class="body1">ENFJ's primary mode of living is externally focused, where they deal with things according to how they feel about them, or how they fit into their personal value system. ENFJ's secondary mode is internal, where they take things in primarily via their intuition. </p>
<p class="body1">ENFJ's focus is on people. Their world is one infused with people possibilities. They have excellent people skills, more so than any other type. Because of their interest in people, they understand them well and always strive to bring out their best. Their main aim is to understand, support and encourage others. They derive a great deal of satisfaction from making things happen for others. </p>
<p class="body1">ENFJs have the ability to make others do exactly what they want them to do. It is these extraordinary people skills that can also make ENFJs master manipulators if it is in their best interest. The opposite is also true; ENFJs tend to define their life's purpose and focus according to other people's needs, to such an extent that they might not be aware of their own needs. Thus, they need to remain aware of their own needs in order not to sacrifice themselves in their drive to help others. </p><br /><br /></td>

<p>Because ENFJs are so externally focused, they need to make time for themselves and create space to be alone. This space might be uncomfortable for some ENFJs as they tend to be hard on themselves, with a tendency to turn to brooding thoughts when alone.</p>

<p class="body1">The focus of the ENFJ is to bring out the best in others, sometimes to such an extent that they are more reserved than other extraverted types. This behaviour might create the impression of being mysterious or even chameleon'like. The idea of being a catalyst to others is stronger than their need to expose their own strongly felt beliefs. Don't be surprised then that it can be relatively difficult to get to know the ENFJ.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFJs have strongly held opinions and beliefs, but if they have to chose between a strongly held value and serving another person's need, it is most likely that they will choose service to the person's needs. The ENFJs tendency to 'hide' can lead to them feeling lonely, even if they are surrounded by other people.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFJs are self confident, full of potential, fast'paced and fun to be with. Others naturally feel attracted to the exuberance and energy of ENFJs, even more so as their focus is on the other person and their best interests. ENFJs like doing many different things and they are usually good at anything that captures their attention.</p>

<p class="body1">People generally enjoy the ENFJ's company; they are fun to be with and also tend to be honest and straight'forward. ENFJs have a great amount of energy that it best directed towards helping people, but they also do well at anything that attracts their attention. They excel in teaching and counselling positions due to their ability to understand and inspire people.</p>

<p class="body1">Reasoning and logic, devoid from interpersonal interaction will most likely frustrate the ENFJ. They enjoy a future orientated focus, and get excited about possibilities, especially those involving other people. They may get bored and restless in the present, especially if there is nothing exciting to look forward to in the future.</p>


<p class="body1">Their strong need for close, intimate relationships brings forth a lot of effort in creating and maintaining these types of relationships. They are known to be trustworthy and loyal, as well as committed, once involved in a relationship. If an ENFJ has not developed their Feeling side, they may have difficulty in making good decisions, and could even come to rely heavily on other people in decision'making processes. If they have not developed their Intuition, they may not be able to see future possibilities, and will tend to judge things too quickly based on established value systems or social rules, without really gaining insight into the current situation. An ENFJ who feels that they do not belong, is likely to be extremely sensitive to criticism and to worry excessively and to feel guilty. This insecurity can cause manipulative and controlling behaviour towards others.</p>


<p class="body1">In general, ENFJs are approachable, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals with richly developed insights into what makes other people tick. The combination of these unique qualities distinguishes ENFJs from other types.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_CTW.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">ENFJs are best applied where they can work with people. They are good at training, motivating, recruiting, counselling, or any organisational opportunity where they can assist and bring out the potential of others. In order to achieve superior performance, the ENFJ needs to have opportunities for interaction and connecting to a higher purpose.
ENFJs are very good listeners and excel in positions where they can apply their extraordinary skill of empathetic listening. They are therefore well applied in relationship building positions, and have the ability to optimise conversations and interactions like no other type. They apply their internal sixth'sense, which allows them to read and interpret unspoken signals.
</p>

<p class="body1">ENFJs are able to coach and facilitate groups to achieve their higher goals and aspirations. Being a mentor or coach is an external process. In connecting with others, they are able to assist in identifying and following up on growth and development opportunities.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFJs are global and metaphoric in their verbal communication. This makes them adept oral communicators, sensitive to nuances and unspoken aspects of communication. Their ability to listen well and to understand the viewpoints and realities of others assists greatly in interpersonal interactions.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFJs are particularly gifted at integration which enables them to see the similarities and differences between people. They provide excellent feedback and do so with warmth, grace and charm. The only Type they possibly frustrate is those looking for concrete task orientated result feedback.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TOF.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">ENFJs work well for organisations that are moral and ethical, those which exist for the 'greater good for all'. For an ENFJ, it is important to know that the organisation is a vehicle for its members to feel significant, appreciated and challenged in a friendly, constructive fashion. They will do their best to add value to this vision and to fulfil a never'ending desire to make work meaningful. ENFJs are concerned with fairness, especially in creating equal opportunities for individual development. If they detect any aspect of falseness or the idea that people are being used, they lose interest and might even campaign for the perceived injustice to be corrected.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFJs value and seek relationships where they can make a positive contribution. They find opportunities to develop and enhance individuals' growth engaging and motivating. It is important to them to know that in whatever the organisation does, it is taking the effect on people into account. As a result they detest a lack of caring; for them, organisations exist to enable people to perform   not the other way around.</p>


<p class="body1">To optimise ENFJ performance, they need to believe in the dreams, ideas and aspirations of the organisation, team or person they are working for. They have a global attitude towards most situations and feel comfortable in a world of abstractions. They function well in spaces where an opportunity exists to develop empathic relationships. These relationships need to be meaningful and deep, and they might become stressed in the absence thereof. ENFJs will not hesitate to walk away from relationships devoid of these characteristics, even if a lot is at stake. As a result they work well where they have access to 'good friends' and experience a feeling of camaraderie. They do not do well in situations requiring them to be false, phoney or pretend in any way. It is therefore important to allow ENFJs to be themselves. Neither will they do well working in teams where the focus is on rationale, logic and tasks.</p>


<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TRL.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">The best way for ENFJs to retain learning is to experience opportunities for interaction, dialogue with others and the written word. They do well in the behavioural sciences as this provides ideas, concepts and theories on how to develop others in global and abstract terms. ENFJs are good at seeing relationships and synthesising, which enables them to simplify the learning process.</p>

<p class="body1">Their people orientation makes them good teachers and, even though they are high'energy people themselves, they have the ability to be patient in order to assist others with the learning process. ENFJs do not particularly like to focus on the detail, preferring a global overview. It is good to remind them that detail is sometimes important, dependent on the aimed outcome of the learning material. If they, however, conclude that a particular discipline or subject is boring, they quickly lose interest and it becomes futile to try to engage them.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFJs are comfortable with theoretical explanations and abstract ideas, and will always look for 'meaning' in their learning experience. Association and rote learning are best avoided, nor does learning by the book do the trick. ENFJs do not learn for the sake of learning, rather preferring to know which results it will achieve, which tools it will provide and how much they enjoy the process.</p>

<h1>Management Style</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_MS.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">As managers ENFJs are democratic and participative. Their focus is on people, and they are likely to lead through coaching, applauding, encouraging and providing ample opportunity for feedback. ENFJs manage in a personal manner where their focus will be on the individual and their needs. Although the goals and objectives of the organisation are important, they will focus on unlocking the potential of the individual to achieve the development needed for their own progression.</p>


<p class="body1">For the ENFJ manager, the goal and use of policies, systems and procedures is to allow people to work well together, minimising misunderstanding and avoiding conflict that can be caused by tasks, roles and purposes. Yet, ENFJ managers will not insist on the use of rules and procedures, and will rather focus on creating a climate of freedom and autonomy that aims to promote the growth of individuals. The progress and growth of individuals takes precedence over systems and procedures, and they are likely to view any changes from this perspective. If a proposed change does not support or benefit people, they are not likely to support it.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFJ manages are acutely attuned to the organisational climate and will always be on the lookout for their subordinates' best interest. ENFJ managers are masters at showing appreciation and tend to give frequent and abundant praise. Likewise, they appreciate the approval of others. They are very loyal, but their loyalty is more to the people in the organisation and less in terms of the institution or organisation.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_PAD.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">The ENFJ's focus on the human element can detract from task completion. Although human beings are important, the organisation will not survive if it does not fulfil its mandate, and ENFJs need to develop an appreciation thereof. Likewise, it will be to their benefit to develop an appreciation for protocol and paperwork; they might not like it, but it is necessary to get the job done. Taking care of the needs of others can be to the detriment of the ENFJ. Developing a strong identity which differentiates them from others, can assist ENFJs to take time and care of themselves. They also need to learn to recognise, speak out and stop situations which sap their energy.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFJs tend to work in best in bursts of energy, which may not coincide with the needs of the job. They work best in environments which allow them the flexibility to capitalise on these bursts of energy, while not being too hard on them for the lulls in between.</p>

<p class="body1">The ENFJ's need for harmony, coupled with their ability to be empathetic, can place them in the middle between opposing forces. It will be good for them to not to personalise the conflict of others and to stay grounded in their own identity. Their need to help others can translate into being organisational victim rescuers. Allowing others to take responsibility for their own lives can save ENFJs a lot of energy. Similarly, they tend to become so involved in others' problems that the possibility exists of creating dependent relationships that are difficult to get out of. Again, the stronger their own sense of identity, the less inclined they are to succumb to such relationships.
