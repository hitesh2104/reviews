<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p class="body1">The INTJ's primary mode of living is internally focused, where they take things in primarily via their intuition. Their secondary mode is external, where they deal with things rationally and logically.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs are comfortable dealing with ideas and making strategic plans. Intelligence is important to them as is competence and knowledge, both their own and that of others. They hold high standards and continuously strive to fulfil these. Their own accumulation of knowledge and know how is slightly more important than that of others.
</p>
<p class="body1">INTJs are comfortable directing their energies towards observation of the world, always seeking to generate and identify new ideas and possibilities. Their intuitive preference is normally hidden from their thinking preference, although intuition is the space where they create and spend most of their time. They are able to make associations related to the information they obtain and are quick to bring new insight to ideas. Where INTPs prefer to follow a concept until is it fully understood, the INTJ is primarily interested in the application of the concept in useful ways. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Therefore, they are driven to come to conclusions about ideas and to take action in order to gain closure on newly acquired information.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs ability to understand, apply and organise systems often leads to a path in the scientific field. Their ability to apply their ideas brings great gifts to the world. INTJs sometimes find it difficult to translate their internal insights, images and abstractions into practical terms, but they will never the less aim to do so in terms of a system or a plan.</p>
<p>Although INTJs prefer to stay in the background, they are capable of stepping forward naturally when they recognise a need to take the lead. Their leadership style will often be marked by effectiveness, as they are able to recognise the reality of a situation and are able to be flexible enough to change things if they are not working. INTJs excel at strategy and improving current strategies, always questioning the current way forward and looking for ways to improve it.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs spend a lot of time internally and might only be interested in the thoughts and feelings of others if it contributes to their ideas and practical applications. In order to forge meaningful and deep relationships, INTJs will do well to develop their Feeling side. It could also be beneficial for the INTJ to focus on developing their Sensing side in order to focus on the details that might make their strategies work better.</p>

<p class="body1">Some of the INTJs greatest contributions are in weighing up, making judgments and forging the ideas they encounter into rational and workable systems. They do not hesitate to speak their mind and trust their intuition. If their ability to express their intuitions and insights are not well developed, they might find themselves often misunderstood by others. In some cases they are seen as arrogant and elitist due to an impulse to dismiss the input and insights offered by others.</p>
<p class="body1">Many INTJs excel in the engineering and scientific fields because of their drive and ability to be so good at long-range thinking. The areas of organising and strategic planning also peak their interest with many following career paths in business. INTJs are not particularly tolerant of the ambiguous and inefficiency and seek clarify in what they pursue with great amounts of energy and time poured into consolidating their insights into structured plans.</p>

<p class="body1">Some INTJs have learned to be more demonstrative in providing positive support and praise, but they are mostly experienced as aloof and a bit reserved due to their introverted and perfectionistic nature. INTJs are open to new suggestions, and although they might create the impression of being rigid, they actually welcome new suggestions to better implement their ideas and strategies. Although they do not often show it, INTJs can feel deep affection and regard for others.</p>

<p class="body1">As is true with all Types, the INTJ revert to the least exercised and preferred preferences. Do not be surprised to find a stressed INTJ becoming obsessed with mindless repetitive Sensate activities (such as alcohol abuse). Another sure sign to identify an overstressed INTJ is when they become immersed in what they would otherwise perceive as minute detail which would not normally be considered important to the overall strategy or plan.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs talent reside in their ability to gain insight into the 'bigger picture' with a drive to synthesise their concepts into solid, workable plans of action. They have a well developed ability to reason and generally create the impression of being competent and able to meet their educational and career goals. Those able to verbalise their ideas and thoughts and allow for intimate relationships, often lead very meaningful lives.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_CTW.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">INTJs bring the skills of analysis and the ability to identify differences and to create categories to the work place. They are especially gifted at creating strategies, mapping out feasible events in advance and developing an agenda, an outline and an overall scheme to the benefit of any organisation they work for. INTJs can build models, solve complex problems and translate theories into actualities.</p>

<p class="body1">They plan well and cover all the contingencies, always having a back up plan ready for the actions they propose.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs are good at communicating with precision and are able to follow the complex conversations of others. They tend to ask many questions, normally focused on bringing insight and clarity. They tend to want to know how things can be done better and is constantly seeking ways and means to become more efficient. INTJs are able to look for shortcuts to do more with less, without compromising effectiveness.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs are normally hard workers and hold achievement in high regard. Their own standards will take precedence above those prescribed by society or the organisation driven to achieve constant evaluation and the improvement of current practices. They are open to change and willing to adjust their plans to the insight brought by others. They are constantly seeking more knowledge, competence and the implementation of their vision of how things can be better. Learning is a lifelong need.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs are skilled at driving and assisting others to achieve organisational goals. They have high expectations of themselves and of those working with them. They value accuracy and precision especially in the achievement of goals through actions to reach their intended goals. They are always on the lookout for problems to solve, especially those that are complicated and difficult, holding a challenge to their intellect. INTJs constantly drive toward competency and will strive to learn as much as they can in order to alleviate the possible fear of failure. As a result their energy will be directed toward change and developing long terms strategies to impact on and effect change. They are especially good at projecting into the future and thinking of things that others might overlook.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TOF.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">INTJs do well in environments that allow them to develop strategies, solve complex problems or implement changes. They are masterful at turning failures into success and can be counted on the implement change around strategies. The ideal corporate space is where opportunities exist to develop and to guide long term strategies aimed at the effective use of resources in an organisation.</p>

<p class="body1">It is though advised to provide the INTJ with autonomy and to allow them to work with others who can act independently on their instructions to implement their ideas and plans. Providing a tolerance for their build in sense of urgency can be applied in situations that call for quick and thorough action plans. They excel at applying their attention in a single minded fashion and value working with others who are knowledgeable, competent and insightful.</p>

<p class="body1">The opportunity to make decisions is best applied in situations that call for a combination between big picture thinking and applying particulars. They are probably better at this than any other of the sixteen types. Although INTJs are especially gifted at the ability to articulate their strategies, they might need support to implement it. Their communication style is precise and they trust logical reasoning above all else. It is advised to provide guidance from the Sensing and Feelings types to assist them in understanding the importance of implementation and to take the Feelings of others into account in doing so.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs tend to probe and test a lot, thinking that nothing is constant. Although they are able to verbalise their ideas well, they are sometimes challenged in communicating these to others. Assistance could be provided in a positive manner, providing the INTJ insight into the aloof impression that they leave with others. Most of the time INTJs are acutely aware of their shortcomings and they will instinctively know how to improve and change to compensate for their shortcomings. Reprimands and performance feedbacks that take this into account, is more likely to have a positive impact. There could also be times when INTJs should be reminded of the escalating high demands they place on others and a tendency to be too hard on themselves.</p>

<p class="body1">Although INTJs can be outspoken, they work best in an atmosphere where self-control and calmness prevails. It is more productive to resolve conflict in a logical, rational and emotionally devoid manner. In fact, they tend to be turned off by over-emotionalising, exaggeration and unbridled imagination, all of which represents inaccuracy to the INTJ.</p>


<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TRL.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">INTJs learn best through conceptualising and abstracting common properties, and developing categories. They can formulate abstract ideas and could find rote and association learning frustrating. They need to be cautious that their fear of failure can cause resistance to learning. If they do not experience the learning experience as the highest possible quality, it can also block their ability to learn. In general, INTJs sets high standards for themselves which lead to life long learning, always eager to find ways to improve themselves and their environment.</p>

<br pagebreak="true"/>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_MS.jpg" alt="">


<p class="body1">INTJs management style will most probably focus on planning as a priority. They are able to outline all the necessary steps to achieve the applications of the models and theories to achieve the long-term goals that they are so gifted in creating. As managers the INTJs energy will be focused on achieving the goals of the vision they have of where the organisation needs to go. They are sensitive to the inner workings of the whole organisation and focus on the how efficient the sub-systems work. Although they are loyal employees, their energy will be directed at the ideas and visions that needs to get the organisation where it needs to go. As a result their loyalties are normally directed at the efficiencies of the system, not the people or the bureaucracy that holds the organisation together.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJs have a preference to work autonomously and on their own. If they need to be team players in order to reach their vision, they can do so readily   as long as the focus is on efficiency. They do well in small teams where the group consists of members who can make a competent and significant contribution. They are careful decision makers, who prefer to think a plan through before they make suggestions and direct the necessary steps.</p>

<p class="body1">Although INTJs know where they want to go and how to get there, they often assume that they have been understood, when it might not be the case. They tend to spend a lot of time internally focused and could be perceived as non-communicative and secretive. A tendency exists to communicate the essential parts of their vision, leaving out an explanation of the detail. It could help INTJ managers to pay attention to this tendency or to work with another type who can assist in this regard. They also need to guard against becoming so conceptual that it is no longer possible to translate their ideas into meaningful work for others.</p>

<p class="body1">INTJ managers often feel embarrassed to give and even receive praise. As a result they tend to withhold positive feedback, thinking that praise is obvious or redundant. They are impatient with any sign of inefficiency and tend to be hard on those who make errors. It could be beneficial for INTJs to receive coaching from another to appreciate the impact of their behaviour on subordinates and to assist in providing positive feedback more often. INTJ managers also have a tendency to bypass or ignore procedures if they think it does not contribute toward the goals of the organisation which could lead to them being perceived as uncooperative and stubborn. Their observations and insights can be sought to improve the policies and procedures they see as a stumbling block.</p>
