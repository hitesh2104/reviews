    	<p class="body1">The ENFP's primary mode of living is externally focused, making use of their intuition to gather information. Their secondary mode, which ENFPs use to deal with their feelings and how things fit into their personal value systems, is internal. Therefore, unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need solitary time to become centered and to reflect on their personal values and purpose.</p>

		<p>ENFPs bring a broad range of talent and skills to the workplace. They tend to be project orientated and may strive to experience a variety of different careers in one lifetime. Once interested, they bring enthusiasm, warmth and interest to the projects and work environments that inspire them.</p>

		<p class="body1">ENFPs seek meaning in life, aspiring to create purpose and being true to themselves. They need to feel that they are living their values, and to follow what they believe is 'right'. It is quite possible that other types might perceive ENFPs as intense individuals for whom emotional excitement is an important part of their lives.<br /></p><p class="body1">ENFPs work best in environments where they have freedom and flexibility, and where they can work with people and ideas. </p></td>

<p>Being independent by nature, they are able to be productive without supervision, provided that they are engaged in what they are doing. Being confined to strict schedules and routine tasks could cause great unhappiness and lead to boredom.</p>

<p class="body1">In general ENFPs are charming, trusting, sensitive and people focused individuals, not adverse to risk taking with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. With such a broad range of skills, they have the ability to fulfill themselves, as well as others, provided that they remain centered and focus on following through with their commitments.</p>

<h1>Contribution to the Workplace</h1>
<br>

<p class="body1">ENFPs primarily bring people skills to the workplace. They prefer to work with and well with others, and enjoy building and sustaining human relationships. They naturally exude warmth, charm and courteousness in their interactions, and are able to make others feel at ease. As such they can listen, facilitate, deploy, train, motivate, counsel and understand others.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFPs work best in an environment that is empathetic and people orientated. Rules, systems and procedures might be perceived as mechanical restrictions denying the work climate of autonomy and freedom, restricting people from reaching their highest potential. ENFPs are able to inspire through their natural enthusiasm which originates from the continuous scanning of the environment for data and to confirm beliefs and values. They communicate well and are able to pick up on the subtle nuances and unspoken communication of others.</p>


<p class="body1">In turn they listen well and, when communicating, tend to use metaphoric and global examples to explain their reasoning and understanding. As such, they are gifted in reporting and rephrasing events so that they become more clear, interesting and valuable to others.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFPs are very good at directing their energy toward unlocking the potential of those they meet. They are skilled in supporting others in the search for their highest and best potential. They enable good will and seek harmony between people, being good at cooperating and getting others to do the same. They bring people together through a shared common cause or purpose, creating significance beyond everyday events.</p>


<p class="body1">The ENFP's energy is typically directed toward change, striving to increase human satisfaction and performance. They are able to see relationships between events, people and things, enabling the identification of inferences not available to other Types. In a position of authority, ENFPs are more likely to 'give information' as opposed to providing 'directives'. Being in touch with others and attuned to their aspirations, their informative 'directives' are frequently followed.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFPs like variety in what they do, being able to invent new ways of doing things. They tend to be flexible, with an ability to adapt to sudden changes in the environment, which becomes more pronounced if these changes involve other people. As a result they tend to become bored with routine and might need occasional assistance to conclude projects. Thus, ENFPs work best in a work environment that calls for variety, allowing them to exercise their ingenuity and creativity to create and maintain a meaningful work situation for fellow employees.</p>

<h1>To Function Optimally</h1>
<br>


<p class="body1">ENFPs are best applied in positions that offer opportunity for interaction, coupled with a higher organisational purpose with which they can identify and feel enthusiastic about. They seek and require inspiration from those they work for, which is important attribute that the organisation or direct manager needs to provide in order to keep ENFPs fully engaged and inspired.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFPs work best in bursts of energy, bringing enthusiasm and motivation to those they associate with. Boredom is their greatest enemy, causing a lack of responsiveness which is hard to influence. It will therefore be advisable to match an ENFPs skills with suitable positions, keeping them engaged and interested.</p>


<p class="body1">Not only are ENFPs skilled at forming and maintaining relationships, they have a great need for empathetic relationships. In order to fulfil a need for rapport, these relationships must be deep, meaningful and authentic. As a result, they are not likely to perform well in assignments that require pretence or deceit. It is best not to expect them to perform in hard, cold and task oriented roles. Being denied access to meaningful relationships can be the cause of great distress, resulting in the ENFP experiencing their external work situation as difficult to cope with</p>

<p class="body1">ENFPs work best for those they believe to be ethical, moral and caring. If they perceive the individual to be otherwise, the ENFP will most likely reject the person's authority, and will not respond positively to feedback, especially if it is negative. Although authority is not granted by the position itself, ENFPs are inclined to respect positional power and to seek approval. ENFPs respect a strong and capable leader.</p>


<h1>To Retain Learning</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_TRL.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">ENFPs learn best through interaction with others, allowing opportunity for dialogue and debate, and making use of the written word. Theory, ideas and concepts intrigue them, while non linear, concrete modes of learning are most likely to frustrate. Being able to see relationships and synthesise assists in the learning process. ENFPs can focus on the 'bigger picture', preferring global learning to focusing on the detail. They are comfortable with learning abstract ideas, but find association and rote learning boring and unappealing.</p>


<br pagebreak="true"/>
<h1>Management Style</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_MS.jpg" alt="">


<p class="body1">ENFPs manage in an outgoing, democratic and participative manner. They are highly people oriented, and lead through their energy and enthusiasm for a cause in which they truly believe. They get to know the individuals in their workspace and manage in a personal manner.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFPs are good at developing systems, procedures and corporate policies aimed at the growth and progress of others, and can become great change agents if they believe it to be for the 'greater good' of others. Motivating employees comes naturally to them, and they have a tendency to get involved in the interpersonal problems of others. ENFPs experience appreciation as essential to their effective functioning and will not hesitate to provide it to their subordinates.</p>

<h1>Potential Areas for Development</h1>
<br>
<img src="/usr/home/assessjqbu/public_html/images/IPT_PAD.jpg" alt="">

<p class="body1">ENFPs need to be careful not to become too involved in interpersonal relationships. Their ability to demonstrate perfect empathy, seemingly knowing what other people need, can distract them from overall work goals and might be abused by others. Identifying easily with others can cause strain on their own identity. Thus, they can become so involved in supporting others that their own wants and needs are subordinated to the support they offer. There might be times when they need to curb their impulsive generosity.</p>


<p class="body1">ENFPs have a tendency to 'block out' information which does not conform to their beliefs. They are naturally interested in the implications of others' actions as well as hidden agendas. They can become so focused on the pursuit of their selective perceptions that a 'reality check' can assist in staying grounded and focused.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFPs might overlook lapses in others' performance, attributing this to the outcome of strained or difficult relationships. As such ENFPs insist on human satisfaction first and performance second, which could undermine overall work productivity. It may also provide fellow employees with an excuse not to take accountability for poor performance. A tendency to perceive systems, rules and procedures as restrictions could cause resistance. ENFPs need to understand that these are necessary to bring order and compliance to the requirements of any work environment.
</p>

<p class="body1">Although gifted in seeing the relationships between events, people and things, there is likelihood that ENFPs can sometimes draw faulty conclusions from their inferences. ENFPs in positions of authority can become despondent and disappointed if their informative 'directions' are not followed. As already mentioned, they have a tendency to become concerned with the personal problems of their subordinates, co workers and even superiors. A possibility exists that these problems can
Being focused in creating a brighter future for all, they tend to overlook detail, which can result in unnecessary mistakes. They also have a tendency to frequently do things at the last minute, which may result in missed deadlines and unnecessary tension. It is therefore important to stress deadlines and assist ENFPs in fulfilling the requirements thereof.</p>

<p class="body1">ENFPs strive for the approval of others and are motivated by positive feedback. They need to be careful not to interpret negative feedback as rejection, leading to unnecessary misunderstanding and unhappiness. ENFPs also tend to interpret the absence of feedback as negative feedback. It is thus important to provide feedback to the ENFP and, at the same time, the ENFP needs to guard against false assumptions being made in the absence thereof.</p>

<p class="body1">Being loyal to the people in an organisation, they become demoralised by frequent staff changes, and might lose enthusiasm for their positions and even find themselves at odds with the system. Able to adapt to change quickly and preferring to work in an activity filled environment, ENFPs need to caution against becoming involved in too many different things at once, being pulled in too many directions by their need to please everyone.</p>
