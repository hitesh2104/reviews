Much of this cautious style stems from their Controlled side, however, which makes them reluctant to reveal information about themselves or their ideas unless absolutely necessary. In fact, highly Compliant individuals are often surprisingly ambitious and have lofty goals, but their innate lack of assertiveness and unwillingness to become involved in confrontational situations makes it difficult for them to achieve these goals directly. Instead, they will tend to use existing structures and rules to accomplish their aims.
