                                     A consent letter will be inserted here (still to be typed). The participant must accept this consent page before he can click on "Go to my tests". 
                                     If the candidate declines, then a page must come up saying that he will not be allowed to continue with the tests. 
                                     He can then come back to this page and agree to the consent page, or confirm that he declines, then the system must send an email to the administrator saying that the participant has declined the consent and will not partake in the testing further
